<h2><i>Rights</i></h2>


<p>"Well," said mother, setting down a cup she
had just wiped, and picking up another, "the
older I get, and the older my children get, the more I
realize how little right a person has even to her own
children. By the time they get&mdash;well&mdash;into high
school they aren't yours any more."</p>

<p>"But, Mother," I protested, dropping a dripping
dishcloth into the dishpan and looking at her in
amazement, "of course we are yours! Whose else
would we be?"</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. Then, "You&mdash;you
belong to yourselves," she said quietly.</p>

<p>America&mdash;the land of freedom and opportunity!
The land where everyone's rights are respected! The
land where the son of a shiftless drunkard can grit his
teeth and say, "I'm going to be rich and famous some
day!" Here in America we pride ourselves on the
fact that everyone has the right to live his own life as
he pleases&mdash;provided, that is, that he does not infringe
upon the rights of someone else.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>Rights&mdash;your rights; my rights. Just what are
rights, anyway?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A group of half a dozen missionaries were gathered
for prayer in a simply furnished living room of a mission
house in China. For a few minutes one of the
group spoke to us out of his heart, and I shall never
forget the gist of what he said.</p>

<p>"You know," he began, "there's a great deal of
difference between <i>eating bitterness</i> [Chinese idiom
for 'suffering hardship'] and <i>eating loss</i> [Chinese
idiom for 'suffering the infringement of one's
rights']. 'Eating bitterness' is easy enough. To go
out with the preaching band, walk twenty or thirty
miles to the place where you are to work, help set
up the tent, placard the town with posters, and spend
several weeks in a strenuous campaign of meetings
and visitation&mdash;why, that's a thrill! Your bed may be
made of a couple of planks laid on sawhorses, and
you may have to eat boiled rice, greens, and beancurd
three times a day. But that's just the beauty of it!
Why, it's good for anyone to go back to the simple
life! A little healthy 'bitterness' is good for anybody!</p>

<p>"When I came to China," he continued, "I was all
ready to 'eat bitterness' and like it. That hasn't troubled
me particularly. It takes a little while to get
your palate and your digestion used to Chinese food,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
of course, but that was no harder than I had expected.
Another thing, however"&mdash;and he paused significantly&mdash;"<i>another
thing</i> that I had never thought about
came up to make trouble. I had to 'eat loss'! I found
that I couldn't stand up for my rights&mdash;that I couldn't
even <i>have</i> any rights. I found that I had to give them
up, every one, and that was the hardest thing of all."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>That missionary was right. On the mission field it
is not the enduring of hardships, the lack of comforts,
and the roughness of the life that make the missionary
cringe and falter. It is something far less romantic
and far more real. It is something that will hit you
right down where you live. The missionary has to
give up having his own way. He has to give up having
any rights. He has, in the words of Jesus, to "deny
himself." He just has to give up <i>himself</i>.</p>

<p>Paul knew all about this. If you do not believe it,
look at I&nbsp;Corinthians 9. "Have we no right to eat and
to drink?" he asks. "Have we not a right to forbear
working?... Nevertheless," he goes on, "we did not
use this right.... Though I was free from all men, I
brought myself under bondage to all, that I might
gain the more" (vv. 4, 6, 12, 19).</p>

<p>Paul, as a missionary, willingly gave up his rights
for the sake of the Gospel. Are we ready to do the
same?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"But," someone will ask, "why should this be especially
true for the <i>missionary</i>? What rights must
be given up on the mission field that a consecrated
Christian at home would not have to give up?"</p>

<p>The following chapters picture some of them.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="Chapter_2" id="Chapter_2"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> 2</h2>

<h2><i>The Right to What I Consider a
Normal Standard of Living</i></h2>

<p class="center"><i>"Have we no right to eat and to drink?"</i>&mdash;I&nbsp;Corinthians 9:4<br /><br /></p>


<p>The white-haired mission secretary looked
at me quizzically. "Well," he said, "it's all in
your point of view. We find that these days in the
tropics people may look upon the missionary's American
refrigerator as a normal and necessary thing;
but the cheap print curtains hanging at his windows
may be to them unjustifiable extravagance!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>My mind goes back to a simple missionary home
in China, with a cheap rug on the painted boards of
the living-room floor. I can see country women carefully
skirting that rug, trying to get to the chairs indicated
for them without stepping on it. Rugs, to
them, belonged on beds, not on floors, and they
would no more think of walking on my rug than you
would on my best blanket! I think of our dining
table set for a meal, and visitors examining with
amazement the silver implements instead of bamboo
chopsticks; and white cloth instead of a bare table. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
think of having overheard our cook say proudly to a
chance comer, "Oh, of course they have lots of money!
Why, they always eat white bread; and they have
meat every day, nearly; and as for sugar&mdash;why, you
just can't imagine the amount of sugar they use!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>English service was over, and we went home with
a lady doctor and nurse of another mission. They
had invited us to Sunday night supper. The sermon,
delivered by a missionary of still another mission, who
was stationed in the city, had been striking and
thought-provoking. The text had been Luke 8:14:
"And that which fell among thorns are they, which,
when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with
cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring
no fruit to perfection."</p>

<p>"This verse must refer to missionaries," the speaker
had begun, "because it says that when they have
heard, they go forth."</p>

<p>He had gone on to describe a picture he would like
to paint. All around the border were to be the "cares"
and "riches" and "pleasures" that hindered the real
work of the missionary. Subjects that hit home were
mentioned&mdash;there would be a big account book that
tied the missionary down so that he had no time for
a spiritual ministry; a teacup, symbolizing the round
of entertaining that may develop in a city where there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
is a relatively large missionary community; a house
and its furnishings, needing constant attention; and
so on. The conclusion of the sermon had been very
solemnizing, because of all these cares and pleasures
and things that are second to God's best, it is tragically
possible that the missionary may "bring no fruit
to perfection."</p>

<p>At the supper table we had an interesting discussion
of the sermon and its implications. Then the
lady doctor made a remark that I have never forgotten.</p>

<p>"When Frances and I set up this house," she said,
"we agreed that one principle must never be violated.
We would have nothing in our house&mdash;its furnishings
its arrangement&mdash;nothing that would keep the
ordinary poor people among whom we work from
coming in, or that would make them feel strange
here."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A standard of living&mdash;what does it amount to?
How important is it? Does it matter whether we missionaries
sleep on spring beds, or those made of boards
(I prefer the latter myself!), whether we eat with
chopsticks, or fingers, or forks; whether we wear silk
or homespun; whether we sit on chairs or on the
floor? Does it matter whether we are poor or rich?
Does it matter whether we eat rice or potatoes? Does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
it matter whether we live in the way to which we are
accustomed, or adopt the way of living of those to
whom we go?</p>

<p>It may matter quite a lot to ourselves. Most of us
like potatoes better than rice. That is to say, most
of us like things the way we are used to having them
rather than some other way. What is to be our attitude
on the mission field? Are we free to try to
have things the way we would like them, and to live,
as much as possible, as we would at home? Or ought
we to attempt, as far as we can, to conform to the way
of life of the people among whom we live? This, of
course, brings us to other questions: Does it matter
to the people to whom we go whether we conform or
not? And, more important, does it matter insofar as
the progress of the Gospel is concerned? Will our
conforming help to win souls to Christ?</p>

<p>The first thing to be said in answer to these questions
is that the standards of missionary living necessarily
must vary with local conditions. In some places
there is a mixture of races and peoples, each in general
keeping with its own customs and dress, and yet
mixing freely with the others. In such places there
may be many Westerners, and Western ways may not
only be familiar, but even adopted to a certain extent
by the local people. In situations like this there may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
be little or no need for the missionary to change his
ordinary way of life.</p>

<p>Most missionaries go to places where the way of
life is different from their own, and to people to
whom their way of life is strange and by whom it
is not understood. It is natural for us to like people
who do things in the way in which we like them
done. We are attracted to those who seem the same
as ourselves, and turn (perhaps unconsciously) from
those who seem queer and different. People of other
lands are the same. When we see someone whose
complexion, features, clothing, language, manners,
and customs are different from our own, our natural
reaction is to stare, or laugh, or both. It is not
natural to be attracted to those who are different from
ourselves. The missionary wants to attract people.
People must be attracted to him before they can be
attracted to his message. They must accept him before
they will accept his message. The more we can
conform to their way of life, the easier and more natural
and more rapid their acceptance of us will be.</p>

<p>The report of a China Inland Mission conference
of missionaries held in England a few years ago includes
as one of the lessons learned from past experience
of missionary work in China, "the will to conform
as nearly as possible to the social and living conditions
of the people to whom we went." This means,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
of course, that different missionaries will live according
to different standards. For example, my sister
Frances and I are both members of the China Inland
Mission. During the past few years I have been living
in the modern and wealthy city of Singapore. I
lived according to an ordinary middle-class standard&mdash;which
meant running water, electricity, gas, and
modern plumbing. I was conforming to the social
standards and living conditions of the people to
whom I went. During the same time my sister was in
the Philippines, living in a palm-leaf hut in a clearing
in the jungle, carrying her own water and sleeping
on the floor. She was conforming to the social
standards and living conditions of the people to whom
she went. Paul says: "I am become all things to all
men, that I may by all means save some" (I&nbsp;Cor. 9:22).
He found what the present-day missionary finds,
that to some extent he must adopt the way of life and
the standard of living of the people to whom he was
sent.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Now, in what measure will it be desirable to adopt
the local way of life? What principles will guide us?
Well, in the first place we will certainly want to become
familiar enough with it so that we feel at home
in their homes. If we find their way of sitting uncomfortable,
and their food unpleasant, they are not going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
to enjoy having us as guests. I may think it disgusting
to eat my rice off a banana leaf with my fingers,
but if I show that disgust, I probably will not be invited
again. And my hostess may decide that I am
merely an unmannerly foreigner, and that there is no
profit in pursuing my acquaintance, or in listening
to the strange stories of Someone called Jesus that I
am so fond of telling. It is also in their homes that we
may become really acquainted with them, and learn
to know their needs. When we have become familiar
with how they eat, how they sleep, how they work,
how they play, what they like, what they dislike, what
they hope, what they fear, how they think, how they
feel&mdash;when we really understand them, then, and
only then, will we be able to present the Gospel to
them in an adequate way.</p>

<p>In the second place, we will want to live in our
own homes on the mission field in such a way as to
make our neighbors feel at home when they come to
call on us. The fundamental attraction will not be
externalities and material things. Even though I live
in a little hut that is identical with their own, if in my
heart I just do not like to have them around, they will
know it, and they will not be attracted to me. But if
not only the love and the welcome are there, but also
a way of life that corresponds to their own, the approach
will be made still easier.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>This does not mean, of course, that I will unthinkingly
accept all local standards. If I go to Central
Africa, I probably will not decide that wearing clothes
is an unjustifiable luxury. There is no need for me to
neglect to sweep the floor of my palm-leaf hut just because
my neighbors do not sweep theirs. The fact that
everyone else chews betel nut, or plays mah-jongg,
does not mean that I will take up these practices. But
I will want, as far as possible, to live the sort of life
that it would be suitable for a native<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Christian to
imitate.</p>

<p>Another point must also be considered here. We
missionaries might voice it like this: "I would love to
live as the native peoples do, if I only could; but I just
can't take it!" It is true that we may not be able to
live entirely as they do and keep our health. The man
who was born and bred in the tropics finds the climate
just what he likes. The same climate takes all the energy
out of the missionary who has come from the
temperate zone. Foreigners are more susceptible to
local diseases than natives. If the missionary eats only
what the local people do, his health may break down.
If he himself does all the household chores in a land
in which there are no modern conveniences, he may
find that he has very little time left in which to study<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the language or preach the Gospel. On most mission
fields it is found that a certain amount of variation
from the local mode of life is necessary if the missionaries
are to continue in good physical and mental
health.</p>

<p>We can, however, gradually get used to unfamiliar
things. I remember once, after I had been in China
a few years, visiting a neighboring mission station.
New workers had arrived there, a young couple fresh
from language school. I was eager to meet them, but
they did not appear. In answer to my inquiry, the reply
was, "Oh, they were invited out to a feast last
night, and it's upset them both! They are both in
bed!"</p>

<p>My heart sank. Whatever use will these young
workers be, I thought, if they can't eat Chinese food?
They won't be able to go to the country and minister
in all the little country churches that are so much in
need of help&mdash;they can't get Western food there!
They had better have stayed at home!</p>

<p>After a few years had passed, however, the young
man mentioned above did start to do country work,
and he did it very acceptably. What is more, he even
came to prefer an ordinary country meal of local food
to the best Western dishes that his wife could give
him at home! Seeing that, I began to realize a thing
that should be a comfort to all young workers who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
find the food or the living conditions difficult. <i>Over
a period of time familiarity not only turns difficulty to
ease, but often even removes the "dis" from dislike!</i></p>

<p>The young worker goes with an older one to make
a call or two. Everything is new. Everything is
strange. Everything is nerve-wearing. If a seat is
offered, it is uncomfortable. If food or drink is offered,
either may be unpleasant. Even if he understands
more or less of what is being said, the conversations
are tiring. And by the time he reaches home he is utterly
worn out. As far as he is concerned, however,
that is not the worst. He looks at the older worker
who has taken him out&mdash;someone getting on in years,
perhaps a bit stooped, and obviously not in the pink
of health. This missionary has done all the younger
one did, and more. He also preached a few times to
crowds that gathered, and he carried on endless conversations,
but just listening made the younger worker
tired. Yet this older man somehow has arrived home
as fresh as a daisy!</p>

<p>The new worker, in his first station, often has to go
through a stage in which he finds everything uncomfortable,
unattractive, and difficult, but there is no
need for him to become discouraged. Even that older
worker probably did too, although he may have forgotten
it! The change comes slowly, and the young
missionary may not be able to see it for a long time,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
but if he everlastingly keeps at it, he will surely find
that, after a few years, familiarity has made the difficult
easy. Most people will find, as well, that it has
even made the distasteful pleasant!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A mother was coaxing her little daughter to eat her
vegetable. "But I don't like it!" the child objected.</p>

<p>"But you will," encouraged the mother. "Just eat
it a few times and you will get used to it. It won't be
long before you really like it!"</p>

<p>The child sat stock-still for a moment, considering.
Then she burst out, "But I don't <i>want</i> to like the horrid
stuff!"</p>

<p>Other people's ways, other people's customs, other
people's standards&mdash;do we <i>want</i> to like them? Or do
we cling tenaciously to our own, insisting that they
are the only good and right ones? It is the attitude of
mind and heart that matters. If we are willing to give
up our own standard of living, willing to live as far
as possible according to someone else's standards, then
surely it is the business of our Master to make that
possible in such degree as He sees is needed and best.
Before we go to the field then, let us give up all right
to our own standard of living, and be ready contentedly
to embrace, as far as He makes possible, that of the
people to whom He sends us.</p>

to live lives of privation, of toil, and perhaps of
loneliness and danger. They will need to trust
God to meet their need in sickness as well as in
health, since it may sometimes be impossible to
secure expert medical aid. But, if they are faithful
servants, they will find in Christ and in His
Word a fulness, a meetness, a preciousness, a joy

<p>I carefully spread a large handkerchief on the
desk to keep my arm from sticking, took up my
pen, and began painstakingly to practice writing the
intricate Chinese characters before me. Every few
minutes I stopped to wipe the perspiration from my
face.</p>

<p>"How about going out to Uncle Wong's with me?"
My sister had come into the room. "The pastor's wife
intended to go with me, but now she has company<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
and can't go. It will give you a good chance to practice
talking Chinese, so the time won't be wasted&mdash;as
far as your study goes, I mean."</p>

<p>We got our umbrellas, palm-leaf fans, and tract
bags, and started off. The sun was beating down, and
the temperature certainly was higher outdoors, but the
breeze gave an illusion of coolness, and the pleasant
country road upon which we soon entered was enough
to make up for a little extra heat. The two miles were
quickly covered, and we found ourselves greeted effusively
by Mrs. Wong and her daughter.</p>

<p>"Imagine you two teachers coming out here today,
when it's so hot! We are entirely unworthy of such
consideration! Why, you might make yourselves ill,
not being used to such heat in your honorable country!
Do sit down and rest! This bamboo bed here
in the shade of the house is a cool spot. Daughter,
get the teachers fans. Oh, you have brought them
with you! Yes, fans are indispensable in this weather!
Quickly start the fire, daughter, and heat water for
tea! Oh&mdash;" a sudden thought struck her, "we have
no tea leaves in the house! Daughter, you run to the
neighbors and borrow some. Don't go to any of these
folk nearby. They are all poor and probably wouldn't
have any. Go to Fourth Aunt's, over in the other end
of the village."</p>

<p>At home we always kept a crock of cooled boiled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
water on hand, but here there was nothing like that;
and drinking unboiled water was as unthinkable to
her as it was to us. We protested vigorously that we
would just as soon have "white tea" (boiling water)
as tea made with leaves, but Mrs. Wong would not
hear of such a thing. Suddenly an idea struck her.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "I know something much better!
Daughter, just run to the garden and pick some cucumbers!
They'll be better than hot tea anyway, and
quench one's thirst just as effectively."</p>

<p>The daughter ran off. After a few minutes the big
son came along with two brimming buckets of cold
well water and poured it into the stone water butt,
which had been almost empty. "Do you prefer to
wash your faces in cold water or hot?" Mrs. Wong
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, cold, please!" we both replied, already feeling
in anticipation that cold water on our hot faces; but
Mrs. Wong, conscience-smitten, was already lighting
the fire. "Oh, I shouldn't have asked such a foolish
question!" she rattled on. "Of course cold water
won't remove perspiration. No, no, it's no trouble.
It will be warm enough in just a minute."</p>

<p>The hot water was ladled into the basin, and Mrs.
Wong looked inquiringly around the room. I poked
my sister. "She's looking for a washcloth," I whispered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
in English. "Quick, tell her we have one, or
she'll be putting their already used one in!"</p>

<p>Fortunately the family washcloth hadn't been discovered
by the time ours was produced; and we proceeded
to wash. I, being the younger, dutifully allowed
my sister to use the water first. "Don't wash
too close around your eyes," said my sister in an aside
to me. "Someone in the family might have sore eyes,
and there might be germs on the basin."</p>

<p>After we had finished with the basin of hot water,
Mrs. Wong took advantage of it, having found her
own washcloth in the meantime. Just at that moment
the daughter returned with her apron full of cucumbers,
and politely offered a large one to my sister. Her
mother quickly snatched it away.</p>

<p>"As big a girl as that, and you don't know anything
about hygiene!" she reproved, sternly. "You haven't
even washed them!"</p>

<p>As the cucumbers were being washed with the cold
well water, I thought to myself that they were probably
no more germ-free after the bath than before.
Unboiled water from shallow wells is not necessarily
free from germs. I said nothing, however. After the
daughter had finished scrubbing the cucumbers, the
mother got a knife and carefully peeled two big ones.
Then she handed them to us. Her own she did not
bother to peel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"We Chinese are very unhygienic," she apologized.
"Of course <i>you</i> wouldn't eat cucumbers without peeling
them!"</p>

<p>What would she have thought if she knew that to
our minds neither the washing in cold water nor the
peeling made them safe to eat? I glanced at my sister,
who was usually very particular about seeing that all
raw fruits and vegetables were scalded before eating,
and was astonished to find that she was placidly and
unconcernedly munching her cucumber. She and Mrs.
Wong were already striking up a lively conversation
about something else. I followed her example, and
found the cucumber very refreshing.</p>

<p>"How can you be so particular about scalding
things at home, and then go out to the country and
eat unscalded cucumbers?" I asked, as we were wending
our way home.</p>

<p>"Oh, we couldn't possibly offend Mrs. Wong by
refusing to eat what she had to offer us!" was my
sister's reply. "We certainly ought to be as particular
as we can when we are in our own home; but when
we are guests, and it's a question of offending someone&mdash;well,
I think the Lord looks after those cases!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Teacups! Beautiful Kingtechen china of the thousand-flower
pattern, thin and exquisite; or perhaps
just a rough earthenware cup, with the handle missing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Everywhere we went in China we found teacups.
Everywhere we went the first thing we were offered
was a cup of tea. Fragrant tea, bitter tea, hot tea, cold
tea; tea served in hand-painted china, tea in an earthenware
bowl&mdash;whatever the cup was, we lifted it to
our lips and drank. What was the first thing we
thought of as we tasted the tea? Whether it was pleasant
or otherwise? The kindness of the one who
offered it to us? Or the dangers that might lurk on
the edge of that cup? For tea, even very hot tea, cannot
be expected to sterilize the rim of the cup; and
who knows who used it previously, or what dangerous
disease he might have had? It had been washed,
of course, or at least rinsed out, but&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't the Chinese scald their dishes when they
wash them?" you ask. Well, do you? "M-m-m, not
always, but the danger is much less in America," you
say. That may be true; but it is hard to realize the
danger of infection in one's own home, wherever it
may be; and even those who live under what we
might call unhygienic conditions are no more conscious
of the danger in their own homes than you are
in yours. I used to think, sometimes, that the most
dangerous thing we met with in China was just an
ordinary teacup, and that the germs that lurked on its
rim were more menacing than tigers or bandits. (Let
me hastily add that in all my fifteen years in that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
country, and having partaken of tea from ten thousand
teacups, more or less, in many places and in
many homes, I am still quite alive, and in good health
and spirits!)</p>

<p>"Now, that wouldn't worry me!" you think cheerfully.
"I'm just not particular!"</p>

<p>I am sorry, but that is not at all the conclusion I
want you to draw from the above remarks. I am giving
no one license for not being careful. No child
of God should feel at liberty to disregard what he
knows to be the rules of good health, just because he
feels like it, much less the man or woman on the
mission field.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The cook comes in with a basket of foodstuffs fresh
from the market. The young missionary spots a particularly
luscious plum, picks it up, and takes a bite.</p>

<p>"Mary!" a scandalized senior gasps. "<i>Whatever</i>
are you thinking of? Eating that plum without scalding
it first! You'll likely get cholera or typhoid and
die!"</p>

<p>Yes, in most mission stations the rules of hygiene
are adhered to very strictly, and it would be a hardy
junior worker who could come through alive without
observing them.</p>

<p>Perhaps several years have gone by. You are in
charge of the home yourself, and the "discipline" relaxes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
a bit. Perhaps you even resort to washing your
fruit in cold boiled water instead of scalding it, because
scalding does spoil it so! Then the younger
workers are sent to you, and you become the head of
a new family. One day, suddenly, one of them gets a
violently upset stomach. Is it cholera? The nearest
hospital is two days' journey away. You catch your
breath, and go ahead caring for her the best you can
with your limited medical knowledge, a constant cry
going up from your heart to the only One who can
help, to Him who is the only all-sufficient One! If
you are fortunate your junior recovers. From that
time on, all the fruit that appears on your table will
be thoroughly scalded.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This is not a chapter on missionary health. It does
not purpose to instruct you in the rules of hygiene.
Rather it inquires into attitudes. Is the missionary to
be as particular as he can about everything (fussy,
some may call it), or should his faith be great enough
so that he overlooks the rules of the doctors? Or perhaps,
are there times when the one attitude is desirable,
and times for the other?</p>

<p>The Lord of the harvest has sent us forth. A dead
laborer, or even a sick one, is not much use. It is
surely our duty to take all sensible precautions, and
whenever possible to use the safeguards to health<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
with which modern science has provided us. We have
no right at all to disobey the rules of hygiene just because
we happen to feel like it. But on the other hand,
when those among whom we are ministering, people
whose training is different from ours, who have no
conception of modern hygiene, out of the love in
their hearts provide us with things to eat and drink,
surely then is the time to say with Paul, "asking no
questions for conscience' sake" (I&nbsp;Cor. 10:27). Surely
in cases where adhering strictly to the rules of
hygiene would hinder the fulfilling of our commission,
we can trust the One who sent us forth to look
after us.</p>

<p>"Please, teacher," said a voice at my elbow,
"wouldn't you like to wash your face?"</p>

<p>We were having a week in the country. For the
fifth time that day, our first full day out, there stood
the pastor's wife, holding out to me a basin of steaming
water. She had just the right combination of humility
and pride in her manner. I quickly stifled the
desire to say, "I don't want to wash! What in the
world do I want to wash my face five times a day
for?" Then I mumbled thanks, and reached wearily
for my washcloth. But a little later I tackled her
about it.</p>

<p>"Do you always wash your face as often as this?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course!" was the quick reply. "All clean
people do! And I was brought up in a very clean
family."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>I let the matter drop, and washed my face (and
my feet) as often as she thought best for the rest of
the trip.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Grandmother Bay's little granddaughter had just
come back from Shanghai. Grandmother Bay proudly
appeared at church accompanied by a prettily
dressed, well-behaved child of about nine. After the
service several of us sat chatting. One old lady looked
at the child's pretty frock, and then gave a quick
glance at her grandmother.</p>

<p>"I suppose that's the Shanghai style," was all that
she said, but Grandmother Bay divined her meaning.</p>

<p>"Just what I thought myself!" She quickly caught
up the remark. "It's pretty material, and nicely made&mdash;cut
a bit closely, but I suppose those Shanghai
tailors do it that way. But the sleeves! Practically no
sleeves at all! It's almost indecent! But you know,
she has hardly a scrap of the material, and I haven't
been able to match it. Otherwise I should have
lengthened them immediately. It's too good a garment
to throw away. I don't know what in the world
to do about it!"</p>

<p>I sat listening with my mouth open. The child was
little enough so that I would hardly have been surprised
to see her running around the yard with nothing
on but a pair of trousers, as many smaller girls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
did. (The boys needed still less!) The objectionable
sleeves were just long enough to cover her shoulders.
What was wrong with that for a child of her size?</p>

<p>I looked at the two women, trying my best to understand
their point of view. What I saw made me
gasp. In that area the older women all wore thigh-length
loose jackets, and loose trousers, as their regulation
attire. It was warm, and one of the two women
had just pulled up her trouser legs. Her short stockings
reached about eight inches above her ankles, and
were held in place by tight round garters. She vigorously
fanned her bare knees as the two, with serious,
troubled faces, continued the conversation about the
"indecent" dress.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>What is decency anyway? In certain groups in
India it is not decent for a woman to show her face,
but her bare feet peep from beneath her long robes.
Things that look perfectly all right to us look indecent
to someone else; and things that look indecent
to us may look perfectly all right to someone else!</p>

<p>A young missionary goes inland to her first station.
"I'm not going to look frumpy!" she declares, and
takes all her prettiest dresses. When she comes out in
gay colors that are not worn in that backward area,
or in short sleeves when everyone else has elbows
duly covered, her senior missionary attempts to suggest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
a bit of alteration in her wardrobe. All suggestions,
however, are indignantly rejected. She plunges
enthusiastically into work with the children, using
pictures very effectively to supplement her limited vocabulary.
One day her two favorite scholars do not
appear, and she asks her helper, a bright high school
girl, the reason. The embarrassed and evasive answer
does not satisfy, and she keeps after the poor girl until
finally she is told the truth. An hour later her
senior missionary finds her weeping in her room.</p>

<p>"She said," she chokes, "she said&mdash;&mdash;that their
mother won't let them come any more because I&mdash;&mdash;because
I can't be a good woman; I dress like a&mdash;a
prostitute!"</p>

<p>What is wrong? Why does the eager young missionary
have to go through all this heartache? Just
because she is not willing to see with someone else's
eyes. Her own standards are the only right ones. She
learns by hard experience the fact that other people
<i>do</i> see things differently from us, and that it <i>does</i>
make a difference. After all, this is their country, and
these are their customs. We cannot expect them to
adjust to ours. It is the foreigner in the strange land
who has to adjust to the ways of that land.</p>

<p>To learn a new language, the ear must be alert to
hear just that little turn with which a sound is pronounced
that makes all the difference between a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
foreign and a native accent. To become adjusted to a
new people, the eye and the heart must be alert to
perceive clearly, to understand and take in their feelings
and their reactions. May God grant us the seeing
eye and the hearing ear!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Oh, they're terribly strict at that Bible school!"
someone remarks. "There are rules about how long
your dresses must be, and how you must wear your
hair. I wouldn't stand for it! Why, it's things like
that that give Christianity a bad name!"</p>

<p>Perhaps. At the same time, one who has shown
that he is willing to give up his own standards and
conform to someone else's, even though he may not
see the reason for those standards, has shown an attitude
that will take him a long way on the mission
field. The "how I do my hair and what kind of
clothes I wear is my own business!" attitude so frequently
met with, both at home and on the field, is
not a promising one. If we have fully given ourselves
to Christ, nothing is our own business&mdash;it is all His.</p>

<p>I had just come back from a strenuous month
in the country. Mr. and Mrs. Sprightly, the young
married couple who were in charge of the mission station,
and I were relaxing around the tea table. I told
about the work I had been doing, and answered interested
questions. Finally the talk drifted into lighter
channels, and Mrs. Sprightly told a funny incident
she had witnessed the previous day in a courtyard
down the street when she had been out for a walk
with her little boy.</p>

<p>"I always like to have Sonny with me when I go
out," she concluded, philosophically. "When he's
along I can stick my nose in anywhere I like. All I
have to do is to say, 'My little boy wants to see what
that is,' and I can wander into their courtyards, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
even into their houses, and nobody thinks anything
about it!"</p>

<p>Curiosity is a common trait, and especially so
among those who are uneducated and unsophisticated.
Missionaries often find those to whom they go frankly
curious. But, strangely enough, there is something in
many of us that rebels against having one's private
life a matter of common knowledge! The one who
has grown up without becoming acquainted with the
meaning of the word <i>privacy</i>, on the other hand, may
find it impossible to understand why the missionary
desires to be alone once in awhile!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The young missionary hears the sound of Chinese
music from somewhere up the street. To her ears it is weird
and unintelligible, but the children at their
play instantly recognize the tune, and raise their
voices in a shout.</p>

<p>"The new daughter-in-law<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> is coming! The new
daughter-in-law is coming!"</p>

<p>A friendly youngster pokes his head in at the missionary's
door. "Wouldn't you like to come and see the
new daughter-in-law?" he asks politely. "The
sedan chair is just arriving. Hurry!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;dear me!" protests the missionary. "Whose
home is this new daughter-in-law coming to? Is it a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
family we are acquainted with?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>that</i> doesn't matter!" the boy assures her.
"Why, everybody goes to see a new daughter-in-law!"</p>

<p>The missionary, reluctantly allowing herself to be
pulled along by the hand, finds it even as the child
has said. Crowds of children, and older people too,
are swarming in at the open gateway through which
has just passed the gaily decorated sedan chair.
Though the courtyard is fairly commodious, it is
packed with people, talking, gesticulating, pushing to
get a better vantage point from which to view the
bride when she alights. The groom and his parents
are graciously welcoming invited guests, entirely unconcerned
about all the hubbub. The bridal chair is
set down to a great popping of firecrackers, the appointed
welcome committee of several girls and one
older woman draws the curtain and assists the bride
to her place in the yard, and the ceremony proceeds.
After it is completed, the bride is escorted with much
formality into the house, and to the bedroom prepared
for her, where she is seated upon a bed resplendent
with red satin quilts. Then the guests, invited and
uninvited, pour into the room. They subject the bride
and her clothes to an interested and careful scrutiny,
commenting upon everything, with much joking and
laughter. As soon as one group gets tired and takes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
its leave, another is ready to push in and view the
"new daughter-in-law."</p>

<p>"The poor girl!" says the missionary. "She looks
ready to drop! When will they ever leave her to herself?"</p>

<p>Not until late that night&mdash;and the same performance
will start again early the next morning. Why,
if there were not a continuous stream of visitors for
three days, the wedding would be thought rather a
flop!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The day had been a busy one. The first visitor had
appeared before breakfast, a precursor of a seemingly
never-ending stream. There were uneducated country
women, whose curiosity could only be satisfied by
going through every room in the missionary's house
and minutely examining each article that met their
eyes. There were those who were educated and formally
polite, and dexterously steered the conversation
into other channels every time we endeavored to present
the claims of Christ to them. There were Christians,
some coming with their troubles, others with
plans for forwarding the work of the church, and still
others with requests for us to set a time when we
could go with them to call upon their unsaved friends
or relatives.</p>

<p>Finally at four-thirty, after we had ushered out a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
couple of callers, we returned, for the first time that
day, to an empty room.</p>

<p>"Come, quickly!" I said to my sister. "Let's go out
for a walk before someone else comes!" I felt as
though I would go crazy if I did not get away&mdash;away
anywhere, just so it was a place where we could be
alone. We hurriedly slipped out the back gate, around
the pond, through the back streets, and out the city
gate.</p>

<p>"Which way do you want to go?" my sister asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, just anywhere into the country," I said immediately,
"where there aren't any people!"</p>

<p>My sister stood stock-still, looking at me in amazement.
"Aren't any people!" she repeated. "Aren't
any people! <i>Where</i> in China do you think you'll find
a place where there aren't any people?"</p>

<p>I stood still and looked around me. The flat countryside
was dotted with villages, and crisscrossed with
paths. Farmers were busy plowing their tiny fields.
Coolies in groups of two and three were returning
home from the city, scattering in all directions along
the many footpaths. People, people everywhere, even
out there in the country! These were the people
whom I had come to China to seek; yet if I could
only get away from them for a few hours! If there
were only some wooded gully or mountain thicket
where I could be out of sight of everyone! But there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
were no mountains; the country was as flat as a tabletop.
I mentally searched the familiar countryside
for a place of refuge. Good, fertile land, cut up into
tiny fields; well-kept crops, with not a weed anywhere;
here and there a little grove of trees&mdash;surely
in among the trees we could be out of sight! But no!
There was no undergrowth, no weeds, not even any
fallen leaves. All had been gathered, carefully dried,
and put in the fuel pile. Why, if a strong wind came
up in the night, the owner of the trees would rise
from bed and hurry out to sweep up the precious
leaves as soon as they fell, just so no unscrupulous
neighbor could come and steal them before daylight!
And all the lower branches of the trees had long since
been trimmed off for fuel. A grove of trees would
hide me from the sight of no one, and there was no
better place.</p>

<p>The full force of an unpleasant fact suddenly hit
me, a fact that I had never before completely realized.
There was absolutely no place that I could go to be
alone! The best that I could do was to go home to
the mission station, into the house, up to my room,
and close the door. Even then, who knew how soon
someone would call me?</p>

<p>Then, in a flash, a little story I had read in a magazine
long before came to my mind. A friend dropped
in to visit a busy mother. The family was large and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
poor, and they lived in only one room. It seemed to
the visitor that the one room was swarming with children.
The mother met her with a beaming face.</p>

<p>"But how can you be so happy," asked the visitor,
"when you can never get a minute to be alone? How
can you find quiet even to pray?"</p>

<p>"It used to trouble me," was the quick reply, "until
I found out the secret. When things get too much for
me, I just throw my apron up over my head, and I am
all alone with the Lord."</p>

<p>Dear Lord, forgive me! I thought. What about
<i>that</i> poor mother? And what about the Lord Jesus?
He wanted solitude just as we do, and He went with
His disciples across the lake to an out-of-the-way spot
to be quiet. The multitudes heard where He was going
and followed by land. When He stepped from
the boat, there were thousands upon thousands waiting
for Him. How did <i>He</i> react? Was there anger in
His heart, or resentment, at never being allowed to be
alone? No; for it says that when He saw the multitudes,
He welcomed them (Luke 9:11). Dear Lord,
give me that same heart of love for the multitudes!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Privacy and solitude are good things, no doubt&mdash;in
moderation. Most missionaries get less of them than
they would desire. There are probably few missionaries
who have not been irritated at one time or another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
when their houses and their persons were subjected
to amazed, or delighted, or even half-contemptuous
scrutiny by the curious. <i>Can't they have the decency
to keep out of what is my own private business?</i> the
missionary thinks. Yet if we belong to the day, if we
are children of light, why should any act of ours, or
anything belonging to us, need to be hidden in the
dark? This is not to recommend a needless parading
of things that normal people prefer to be reserved
about. Let us remember, however, that people must
come to know us before they can accept our message,
or before our testimony has any value to them. Why
should I desire to keep hidden <i>anything</i> that has to
do with myself&mdash;<i>if the sharing of that thing might
help to draw someone to the Saviour?</i></p>

<p>"Mrs. Ning and I are going out to see Grandma
Woo, who has been sick. Wouldn't you like
to come too?"</p>

<p>I was sitting at my desk, with all the paraphernalia
of Chinese study spread out before me. I looked at
my desk, looked at the clock, looked at my sister, and
then asked, "How soon will you be back?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we shouldn't be too long! Of course Mrs.
Ning walks slowly, with her small<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> feet; but it's only
a mile, and we don't need to stay very long. You
never know, but we ought to be home in plenty of
time for dinner."</p>

<p>Well, I thought to myself, I suppose I ought to go;
but I wanted to finish translating this chapter, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
I'll be doing well to get it done in three hours. And
I had thought that I'd get it finished this morning,
and be able to write letters this afternoon. Still&mdash;</p>

<p>Unfortunately for my peace of mind, I knew two
things. One was that my sister thought that I ought
to go, and the other was that she was right.</p>

<p>"Well," I said finally, "I'll go; but let's not stay
long."</p>

<p>We got our sun hats, joined Mrs. Ning, and started
off. Her feet were not more than six inches long, and
she <i>did</i> take such tiny steps! Try as I would to walk
slowly, I continually found myself going ahead of the
other two. My sister by nature is in more of a hurry
to get things done than I. Still, here she was, wandering
along beside Mrs. Ning as if she had all the time
in the world, listening intently to a tale about Mrs.
Ning's third aunt's cousin, and putting in sympathetic
interjections and questions now and then.</p>

<p>I could not seem to get interested in the story, even
though Mrs. Ning was telling how she had tried to
get this third aunt's cousin to bring his troubles to the
Saviour. I could not understand all of what she said,
and was unable to keep up with all the ins and outs
of the poor cousin's troubles, so finally I gave up trying.
It was a beautiful day. The sky was blue, and the
wheat, high and greenish-gold, rippled in the wind.
We turned off the road and followed a little path<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
running through the wheat fields. My sister almost
unconsciously began slipping the full heads of grain
through her fingers, one after the other, as she passed.
She always loved the wheat, and so did I, but somehow
today I did not want to touch it. I only wished
that we would hurry.</p>

<p>At last we arrived at the village, and made our way
to the home of old Mrs. Woo. As usual, a crowd of
dirty, staring youngsters followed us into the house.
We sat on benches that were about eight inches wide,
and sipped "tea" that could be called so only by courtesy;
since, having no tea leaves, they had instead just
put a few slices of raw sweet potato into the kettle
when it went on the fire. Old Mrs. Woo was up and
around again, and feeling lively.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you've come! I've been telling my
neighbors all about the Lord Jesus, and how they
ought to believe in Him, but I'm afraid I don't do it
quite right. Now that you've come you can tell them!
Here, you, Kitten," speaking to one of the crowd of
children that had followed us into the house, "you run
home and get your grandma to come. And you, Girlie,
your second great-aunt said that she wanted to believe.
Run fast and tell her that the teachers have come. All
of you youngsters, you scoot home as fast as you can
and get your mothers and grandmothers to come and
listen to the doctrine!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>It took quite a lot of persuasion to get the children
to go; and perhaps the mothers and grandmothers
were busy. We waited in vain for quite awhile, but
finally in came three or four women, one with a cloth
shoe sole she was quilting, and another carrying a
baby. After quite a bustle, they were all seated and
given bowls of tea. Then out came the poster that
my sister always carried, and the Gospel was explained
to them in very simple words. With great
effort I managed to keep my mind on the message,
and understood most of it. I congratulated myself internally.
At last I had successfully wrested my mind
from the absorbing but uncomfortable subject of all
the things that I had wanted to get done that day!</p>

<p>The preaching was finished. The women got up to
go, assuring us that they would come with Mrs. Woo
to church the next Sunday. We got up too, and started
to say good-by.</p>

<p>"What! Go home!" said Mrs. Woo. "Who could
think of such a thing! Of course you'll stay for dinner
with me! Why, it's almost ready!" (We knew perfectly
well that the only womenfolk in the family
were herself and her daughter-in-law, and that neither
had left the room since the tea had been brought in.)</p>

<p>My sister and Mrs. Ning protested, and even I managed
to add a few polite words. But my thoughts were
not so courteous. Stay for dinner! What an idea!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Why, that would mean that we would not be home
before the middle of the afternoon at the earliest!
And besides, the meal would probably be some miserable
stuff that I could hardly force down! Oh, well,
likely she was only asking us in order to be polite, and
did not really mean it!</p>

<p>With great difficulty we made our way toward the
door. Mrs. Woo and her daughter-in-law hung on us
until we could hardly move, protesting loudly that
they would not think of letting us leave. My blood
began to boil. I guess we had the right to go home
when we wanted to! They were actually trying to
force us to stay! Well, I would not stay in any case
now! This was just too much!</p>

<p>We had reached the open door, and just then
caught sight of an old woman hobbling rapidly across
the yard toward us.</p>

<p>"Oh, Girlie's second great-aunt!" called Mrs. Woo.
"Here you are at last! Why didn't you come sooner?"</p>

<p>"Well, I had company, and I just couldn't get
away. But finally my daughter-in-law came back, and
I left them with her and came as quickly as I could. I
was so afraid that the teachers would be gone. But,
oh, surely you're not leaving?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, of course they're not leaving! You don't
think that I would let them come under my roof and
not keep them to a meal! It will be nothing like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
they're used to, of course; but still a meal is a meal!
Now, just sit down, teachers, please, and Mrs. Ning.
Girlie's second great-aunt has wanted to believe for
some time, but her son is very mean to her, and he
won't let her go to church. Do you think that she
could believe at home?"</p>

<p>I could not believe my eyes. My sister and Mrs.
Ning sat down obediently and began to talk very
sympathetically with the old woman who had just
come. What! Were they actually going to stay to
dinner? And not a word to me, just as if what I
wanted did not matter at all! <i>They</i> could talk to this
old lady, and tell her about the Lord, but all <i>I</i> could
do was just sit! Of course I was supposed to listen;
but one could not put her brain to listening to this
queer Chinese <i>all</i> day long! And what about all those
things that I had wanted to get done?</p>

<p>The dinner was no better than I expected. In fact,
it was worse. Girlie's second great-aunt stayed too,
upon urging, and they all talked on and on. They
were trying to teach her a little prayer, and she was so
stupid! Over and over and over, and still she could
not say it by herself.</p>

<p>Finally, when I had given up all hope&mdash;I had sat
in stony silence all the afternoon&mdash;we got up, made
our farewells, and started home. The sun was setting
as we entered our front gate. I was tired (why, I did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
not know; I had not done a thing all day), hungry
(I had not been able to eat much of the dinner, no
matter how it had been urged upon me), and disgusted.
And the worst of it was that it did not seem
to bother my sister a particle. She took it all as a matter
of course. Was this what I was going to have to
go through; what I had come to China for? For I began
slowly to realize that today's experience was not
just one isolated incident; it was likely to happen any
day in the year. Something was wrong somewhere.
What?</p>

<p>Suddenly it came over me. It was only that I had
had my day all planned out, and did not want my
plans interfered with. Because they had been interfered
with, I had done nothing but sulk. All the
things I might have enjoyed I had not enjoyed at all.
I had made myself miserable for a whole day, just because
my time had been disposed of by someone else,
and not by me.</p>

<p>"Dear Lord," I said, "I'm not going to go through
this again! I know it was really You who disposed of
my day when I wanted to do something else with it!
Give me an open mind, Lord, so that whenever I go
to the country, whenever I start a new day, I'll be able
to accept whatever comes, and rejoice in it!"</p>

<p>It is amazing how much difference a little thing
like one's mental attitude can make. After that, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
I went to the country, I never took with me any preconceived
notions of what time I would return. I
might get back home for my noon meal, or I might
get back by sunset, or I might even stay overnight&mdash;what
difference did it make? My time belonged to the
Lord, and it was up to Him to dispose of it. I found
that with this attitude of mind I could go anywhere,
take advantage of any opportunities offered, stay more
time or less time than I had expected, and still enjoy
every moment, because God had planned it, and had
worked it out in the best possible way.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<h2><i>The Right to a Normal Romance, If Any</i></h2>


<p>I was in the CIM Mission Home in Vancouver,
B. C., an accepted candidate. In two more weeks
I was to sail for China, the land where three of my
sisters were already laboring as missionaries. One had
been out for six years, had been married while on the
field, and was almost ready for furlough. The other
two sisters had been out a shorter period. They were
both single, and stationed together. That day I had
received a letter from them written from a little hill
resort operated by our Mission, where they and others
had gone to escape the worst of the summer heat.
Now, for missionaries, a summer resort is the most
common place for a romance to develop! The letter
was a gay description of their life there, and ended
with the following sentence:</p>

<p>"There are thirty-three of us here now: seven married
couples with nine children, nine single ladies, and
one single man! There is one more single man expected,
we hear, but even at that, I'm afraid there
isn't much hope for us!"</p>

<p>The dinner bell rang, and I hurried down. But who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
was that elderly couple in the old-fashioned clothes?
Perhaps I had been told that they were to arrive that
day, but if so I had not remembered it. They were
introduced all around the circle&mdash;missionaries who
had just come from China! We sat down, and I found
myself beside the lady.</p>

<p>"What did they say your name was?" she asked,
apologetically. "I have such a time remembering
names."</p>

<p>I told her, and she immediately pricked up her
ears. "Williamson!" she said. "Don't you have a
sister in China?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have three there," I replied.</p>

<p>"Well, isn't that a coincidence! When I was in
Shanghai I heard&mdash;no, you couldn't have heard it yet,
for the news was just out&mdash;I'm <i>sure</i> it must have been
your sister! Anyway, just before we left Shanghai
there was a great hubbub about the news of a new
engagement, and I'm almost certain&mdash;Dear," turning
to her husband, "who was it that we heard was engaged,
just before we left Shanghai?"</p>

<p>Her husband did not remember. "Well, I'm almost
sure it was your sister, anyway!" she declared.</p>

<p>"My sister! But it couldn't be!" I replied rather
dazedly, thinking of the letter I had just received.
"Which one? What was her first name?"</p>

<p>Unfortunately she could not remember that, nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
did she know that there were two Miss Williamsons
in China. And as for the name of the man&mdash;she had
no idea about that, either. The whole thing seemed
extremely vague, and altogether unlikely, and I dismissed
it from my mind.</p>

<p>A week later I received another letter from my
two sisters. To my amazement I read the news that
the younger of them had just become engaged to the
single man who had arrived at the hill resort the day
after the previous letter was written!</p>

<p>After I had partly recovered from the shock, my
mind went back to what I had heard of the courtship
of my married sister, also in China. The man who
later became her husband was stationed at a place
a thousand miles from where she was. They had been
very slightly acquainted when they were in Bible
institute in America, six or seven years before. Suddenly
he started writing to her, and after two or three
letters, asked her to marry him. When she went down
to Shanghai for the wedding, practically all she knew
of him was from his letters.</p>

<p>The other sister, who went with her at that time,
told me later that when they went to the railway station
in Shanghai to meet the expected groom, who did
not arrive until the day after they did, she almost had
heart failure. After they went to bed that night she
could not go to sleep for thinking, "What if she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
shouldn't want to marry him, now that she's seen
him! I'm sure <i>I</i> wouldn't!"</p>

<p>Succeeding days set her mind at rest, however, for
it was quite evident that the promised bride <i>did</i> want
to marry him&mdash;and so it turned out all right after all!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"What a strange family you come from!" you say.
"Your sisters rush into marriage in such a precipitous
way!"</p>

<p>No, not at all. Such courtships are fairly common
among missionaries. The reason for this is obvious.
There is very little opportunity on the mission field
for becoming acquainted with eligible persons of the
opposite sex. Unless the missionary is prepared to
give up his calling in order to marry, his range of
choice is necessarily limited to other missionaries; and
missionaries, when at work, are usually widely scattered.
Most of our mission stations had only one
household, with only two, three, or four missionaries.
Obviously, it would not be very likely that two single
workers of opposite sex would be included in the
group; to say nothing of the fact that such an allocation
of workers would normally be considered highly
unconventional! Usually single women workers were
sent to one station, and a man (or men, if there were
that many) to another. Missionary travel, except for
going to a summer resort, was usually confined to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
one's own district, and missionaries working outside
that district met very infrequently.</p>

<p>Another factor that must be taken into consideration
is the restriction which local custom puts upon
social mingling of the sexes in heathen lands. Most
missionaries live in near contact with the people, and
it is only right that they should do so. The missionary
who prefers to withdraw from the people is not likely
to make many converts. Local people, both Christian
and heathen, are encouraged to come freely into the
missionary's home, and much of his work may be
done by just such quiet contacts. The missionaries
come in as strangers. They present a new way of life.
Is it any wonder that, as much as is possible, everything
that they do is watched? Sometimes the watching
is in order to criticize; sometimes it is in order to
imitate; but always they are watched. If what the
watchers see seems good to them, they may give themselves
to the One about whom the missionaries preach.
If they see things that offend them, they may stumble
and turn away. Because of this, local conventions
<i>must</i> be taken into consideration; and in many heathen
lands what we would call only ordinary friendliness
between two persons of opposite sex would be
looked upon not only with disapproval, but even with
suspicion.</p>

<p>Mission rules in regard to such matters are usually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
very strict, as the following quotation from <i>The Overseas
Manual of the China Inland Mission Overseas
Missionary Fellowship</i> (1955) will show!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is important that the missionary in his daily
life among Eastern peoples should maintain a
standard of dignity and courtesy which is essentially
Christian and not merely Western. It must
be remembered that a careless disregard of local
conventions will give offense to nationals whose
good opinion is of value, and may prove a serious
hindrance to the progress of the Gospel. Great
care should be taken particularly by lady workers
when extending hospitality to missionary brethren
or <i>vice versa</i>, lest any action lead to misunderstanding
and injury to the work. Engaged couples
should also be especially careful of their deportment,
remembering that they will be setting a
standard of behavior for young Christians no
longer bound by old conventions and looking,
perhaps, for guidance to their missionary friends....
Engaged couples will not be designated to
work in the same center (pp. 21, 22).</p></div>

<p>So, between the limitation that a narrow circle of
eligible acquaintances sets, and the restriction entailed
in conforming to local custom, young missionaries
may often feel that the chance for any normal kind of
romance is snatched from them. Small wonder that
the summer resort and the post office, the two avenues
of courtship left open to them, are speedily utilized,
and that engagements are often made on what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
would seem at home to be too short acquaintance! If
<i>you</i> knew that you had only a few weeks in which to
become better acquainted and do your courting, and
that when those few weeks had passed each would return
to his own station, with no opportunity of meeting
again for at least another year, perhaps you
would speed things up too!</p>

<p>If the choice of a life partner were a matter to be
decided purely "on one's own," then this sort of situation
on the mission field might lead to many a tragedy.
Thank God, that is not the case! After all, He
is the One whom we want to make the choice for us,
and He can be depended upon. Certainly any young
missionary should make this a matter of definite
prayer. If God has chosen the two for each other, He
will see to it that they meet; and He will bear witness
in their hearts as to His leading, so that they need not
hesitate or fear. If we set our hearts on some certain
thing, irrespective of whether or not it is His will, disaster
will result. If we commit the matter entirely to
Him, and trust Him to work out His own perfect will,
we can go ahead, with confidence, knowing that the
union (if He indicates it) will be as the path of the
just, that "shineth more and more unto the perfect
day." If anyone doubts this, let him look at any missionary
couple. In spite of all the difficulties and dangers,
the percentage of happily married couples must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
be greater among missionaries than it is anywhere
else!</p>

<p>To any thinking young person, another problem,
not yet discussed, must be evident. If there are twice
as many single women as single men on the mission
field (and there are), some of the women must either
marry men who are not missionaries, and so leave the
field, or else remain single. The shortage of men on
the mission field is often deplored, and it is true that
in many cases the work would be better off with a
larger proportion of men. I shall always remember,
however, hearing one of my sisters say: "Before I
came to the mission field I thought that the reason
there were more women than men on the field was
that more of the women were wholly consecrated to
the cause of Christ; but after I had been out for some
time I changed my mind. Now I believe that God
calls more women than men because <i>more women are
needed</i>."</p>

<p>The army of unmarried women missionaries on the
field is there, not because there happen to be more
women than men on the field, and, since we do not
believe in polygamy, some were left over; but because
there is a work that they can do that no one else can.
Most men need wives, and the fact that a man has a
wife and family is more of a help than a hindrance in
most types of missionary work. A man missionary can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
leave his family for weeks or months, and even
though married, he can engage in the arduous itineration
that is often necessary. But a married woman missionary,
as soon as she becomes a mother, is bound to
her children, and that usually means that she bound
to her home. She can engage in missionary work in
the place where she lives, but she cannot travel easily.
She cannot go out for weeks or months with a women's
evangelistic band. She cannot go from church to
church, holding Bible classes for the women. In many
places, when teams of men workers go about, the
women are left almost untouched. There must be
women workers to reach the women. There is plenty
of work for the married woman missionary to engage
in; but there are certain types of work which her responsibilities
will not allow her to undertake.</p>

<p>"That's the type of work I want to do!" declares
one young woman. "To spend weeks and months in
the country villages, living in the people's homes and
really becoming one with them&mdash;that's the only work
that counts! <i>I</i> shall never be married."</p>

<p>"Oh," says another, "I'm sure there is much work
a married woman can do that would be impossible to
the single woman. Anyway, I wasn't cut out for a
spinster! It doesn't matter if there <i>are</i> only half as
many men as women; <i>some</i> of the women get married,
and I'll be one of the 'some.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, friends, both of you are wrong. It's not up
to you to say what sort of work you want to do, and
it's not up to you to say whether you will be married,
or one of the single crowd. Since most girls want to
be married, it is a good thing for each to face the possibility
that God <i>might</i>, for a reason, want her to remain
single; but that does not mean that I am encouraging
anyone to take a vow of celibacy! I know
of one young woman missionary who told various
fellow workers, and even some of the local Christians,
that she was never going to get married. The Lord
began to deal with her&mdash;at the same time that a
young man was laying siege to her heart! She finally
surrendered to the Lord, and gave up her cherished
dreams of the kind of missionary career she had
mapped out for herself. A few years later she was a
happy missionary wife and mother!</p>

<p>Most of the above is particularly directed to young
women, but it may apply to young men as well. In a
limited number of cases it may be necessary for men
to remain single, particularly those who engage in
pioneer work of a sort that would be impossible for
women. This probably means giving up anything
that could rightly be called a "home." Even where
two single men are together, "batching it" is usually
a sorry business; but when the call of the Lord comes,
He will give grace. In that respect it is much easier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
for women. Two unmarried women can live together
and make a home that seems like a home; most men
do not seem to have that gift!</p>

<p>The advantages and disadvantages of the single
woman missionary, as over and against those of the
married woman (or vice versa) are often debated.
The single woman certainly has the advantage in
being able to give all her time and energy to the work,
though the married woman can give help to married
women in a way that an unmarried woman cannot.
It is not a matter for anyone to decide arbitrarily. Remember
that "each man hath his own gift from God,
one after this manner, and another after that" (I&nbsp;Cor. 7:7).
Whatever God has called us to do, we <i>can</i> do.
Each state has its own blessings. When one sees the
"trouble in the flesh" (I&nbsp;Cor. 7:28, K.J.V.) that
bringing up children on the mission field entails,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> it is
almost enough to make one feel that the single state
is the easier. It <i>is</i> easier in some ways, of course. Yet
remaining single is not easy either. Every human
heart longs for someone to "belong to," and perhaps
the hardest thing that the single missionary has to
face is that she can never, never say to anyone, "I'm
going to stay with you."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"After marriage a lady worker continues to be
a missionary in active service and her changed
status will afford new opportunities for service.
She will need rightly to apportion time to language
study, home duties and her calling as a

and habits, but if the responsibilities of married
life have been prayerfully accepted the varying
claims on time and strength will not result in a

<p>"The establishing of a Christian home should be
for the glory of God and the spread of the Gospel.
One danger to be avoided is that of missionaries
becoming so absorbed in their home as to
neglect an active ministry amongst the people
to whom they have been called. It is the mutual
responsibility of both husband and wife to see
that each does not hinder the other from fulfilling
his or her ministry. Where there are children, it is
recognized that new responsibilities are involved,
but care should be taken that family claims do
not monopolize the time and energies of either
parent. Children who grow up in an atmosphere
of loving yet firm discipline are not only a joy to
their parents but an asset to the work of the Gospel.

<p>What a wonderful thing is a Christian
home! What a privilege to be able to establish,
among thousands of darkened, pagan homes, one
that is truly Christian; and to be able to live out the
love of Christ in actual family relationships before
people who know nothing of it!</p>

<p>This privilege has not been given to me. The Lord
has not led me in that path. And yet, as I have observed
many young couples on the mission field, and
older ones too, I have been able to see a little of the
price they have had to pay. The outsider, looking on,
saw only the love and blessing that radiated from
these homes. But as I lived in some of them, I found
that these young couples were faced with constant
problems, and even frustrations, and I wondered
whether or not I could have overcome all obstacles
in the gallant way in which they did.</p>

<p>Shall we take a look at the sort of thing a young
married couple on the mission field has to face? We
will call them John and Mary, and make them just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
ordinary folk who meet the kind of situations most
young missionaries meet.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A home of her own&mdash;that was what Mary longed
for. She and John had been married a few months
before leaving for the field, had studied for a term
in language school, and now were living with an
older married couple until their acquaintance with
the language and the customs of the people was
enough to warrant their being sent to a station of
their own. Mary found the language easy, but John
found it hard; and they had been on the field for more
than two years before their desire for a home of their
own was realized. It was just as well for Mary that
she was quick with the language. Little David was
born when they had been out only a year, and looking
after David meant that she had several hours less
each day for study than John had.</p>

<p>When they finally got to their new station, they
were surprised to find that long, uninterrupted hours
for language study, which they still needed, were almost
impossible. There was a little church in the
place to which they had been sent, and of course they
wanted to do what they could, with their limited
language, to help. They found a language teacher,
but he was not as good as their previous one. Mary
had a girl to help her in the house, but she was untrained,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
and for the first few months Mary thought
that it was more work training her than it would
have been to do the work herself. They had many
visitors, both Christians and others. John loved to
sit and talk with the men who came, and although his
facility in the use of the spoken language developed,
the progress he made in the book work required by
the course of study was extremely slow. Mary often
longed to shoo the men visitors out the door, lead
John into his study, set him down at his desk, and
shut him in with his books!</p>

<p>With the care of the baby and the responsibility
for the home devolving upon her, it was a good thing
that Mary did enjoy study. She often said that she
thought the Lord gave her, as a young mother, special
help with the language, because He knew how
much she had to do! Because she was so busy, however,
she often sat up later at night over her books
than was good for her health, and she became tired
and worn out. The flu came along, and she was an
easy victim. Poor John! He had to be nurse, housekeeper,
and baby-tender, all at the same time. The
thing that worried Mary the most about being ill was
that she was keeping John from his studies.</p>

<p>Mary was not entirely back to normal health when
David's little sister was born. What a darling she
was! Before her illness, Mary had been giving a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
short Bible talk at the women's meeting every other
week; but now it seemed impossible to find time for
the hours of preparation such a talk entailed. Because
of her slow recovery it was finally decided that
she and the children must go to a hill resort earlier
than usual that summer. When she returned, she was
horrified to realize that it had been six months since
she had given a message in the native language.</p>

<p>She was feeling much better in every way, however,
and settled down to "get back into the work." The
girl who helped her had developed nicely, and now
the two children could be entrusted to her care. In
spite of John's slowness at the language, he had always
been able to make himself understood, and the
little church was growing. With his encouragement,
they had started a preaching band, and went to nearby
towns and villages with the Gospel. Sometimes
they stayed away for several weeks at a time. They insisted
that John accompany them; and indeed, he
would not have been happy anywhere else. But more
and more Mary found herself left alone at home with
the children. Where was the happy home that she had
wanted to establish for John? He was as dear and as
kind as ever when she saw him&mdash;but he was away so
much! And during the times he was at home, there
were often visitors to see him. On evenings when
there were no visitors she always longed to say,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
"Come and sit in the easy chair, John, and we'll have
a cozy time together," but her Puritan conscience usually
overcame the promptings of her heart, and instead
she would look at the clock and say brightly,
"Oh, there's still time for you to get in an hour or two
of study! Isn't that nice!"</p>

<p>The time passed rapidly. John <i>did</i> persevere with
his language study, and very slowly got off the required
examinations. Mary never had as much time
as he did for study, but she usually kept ahead of
him in the book work. She did not dream of trying to
rival him in his knowledge of the spoken colloquial!
At first she used to save up her problems for him to
deal with, but she found that when he returned from
a country trip he was always so tired that she did not
like to burden him, and soon she was struggling alone
with most of them. The children grew rapidly, and
usually kept in health, although there were several
occasions when they had serious illnesses. At such
times she would realize afresh that, although the nearest
fully qualified doctor was several days' journey
away, the Great Physician was always near!</p>

<p>When David was four, two new missionaries, fresh
from their term at language school, were sent to be
with them&mdash;two bright, happy girls, whom Mary
welcomed with all her heart. The care of the larger
household took more time, but she did not grudge it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
One was quick at the language, and one was slow.
When the discouraged one would come with her
troubles, Mary would comfort her by telling her that
John had been slow too! The two girls became very
fond of the children. Mary was almost overscrupulous
about not allowing them to disturb the two, who were
supposed to be giving all their time and effort to
language study. The quick one, Alice, raced through
two language exams, and then had a week in the
country with the women's evangelistic team (organized
a year previously, Mary being one of the chief
promoters). It was what Mary had longed to do herself
ever since the band was started, but&mdash;well, she
had her babies! After all, they <i>were</i> the most precious
children in the world! But when Alice returned, bubbling
over with the novelties and thrills of a week in
the country (fortunately she was not afflicted with a
delicate digestion, and could eat anything with relish&mdash;and
comfort!), poor Mary, had all she could do to
"rejoice with them that do rejoice." Afterward, in the
privacy of her own room (John was not at home, and
the children were asleep), she finally let go, and the
sobs came&mdash;stifled by the bedclothes, so that the children
would not be awakened.</p>

<p>And then it was time for furlough! The homeland
seemed strange at first, but they soon got used to
things. Everyone was extremely kind, and showered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
them with gifts. The meeting with loved ones and
friends was all that they had expected; but the strain
of living with their children in other people's homes
(even though they were the homes of their own dear
ones) made things difficult. The relatives constantly
petted the children, and discipline became a problem.
Finally they were able to get an apartment of their
own for a few months, and David started kindergarten.
John was constantly in demand as a deputation
speaker, and he traveled back and forth, speaking
in many places. Sometimes Mary thought, with
a sigh, that she saw less of him on furlough than she
had on the field!</p>

<p>Certainly they were having a wonderful time at
home, but still it would be nice to get back to the
field again! Then, with the thought, came a stab of
pain&mdash;for she knew that when that time arrived it
would mean sending little David off to school. The
school for missionaries' children was a long way from
their part of the field, and the most they could hope
for after that was to have David during the summers,
and on their furloughs. Her little David! Going so
far from home, among strangers! Perhaps she could
keep him awhile, and teach him at home. If only the
leaders of the Mission were not so strict about insisting
that all children of school age be sent to the
school for missionaries' children! What did they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
know of a mother's love for her little boy? But before
this thought was fully formed, her heart was
reproving her. Of course they knew. Most of them
had children of their own. It was all for the children's
good. She had no training for teaching, and look
how busy she had always been! Wherever did she
think she would get time to teach David?</p>

<p>Besides, her mind ran on, David needed to be
with other children of his own age and race, and to
get the "give-and-take" that school life provides. Kindergarten
had already been a help. And on the field
there were so many other difficulties! While they
were still there, she had tried her best not to let
David feel that he was different from, or superior to,
the children he played with; but she just couldn't let
him do all the things that they did. And he had always
wanted to know, why&mdash;why couldn't he wipe his
nose on the back of his hand, as all the other children
did? Why did he have to go to bed at a certain hour,
when all the other children stayed up as long as they
wished? She certainly had never said, "It's because
you are an American, and we are different," but somehow
David had seemed to acquire that sort of attitude,
and to feel that he was superior to the local children.
She still remembered how helpless she had felt in trying
to deal with the situation!</p>

<p>Well, it did seem that sending him away to school<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
would be necessary if he were not to grow up proud
and overbearing. Then too, she remembered the day
she had to spank him because he had become angry
and shouted at one of his little playmates in very filthy
language. Where had he learned those words? (He
had picked up the language, good and bad alike, without
even trying!) She wouldn't even have known
what the words meant, but she had overheard the
Bible woman scolding him, and had gone out to see
what was wrong. The Bible woman hadn't wanted
to tell her, but she would not be satisfied until she did.
No, if her boy was going to learn filth like that by
being inland with her, there was no help for it&mdash;he
must go to school. "Dear Lord," she prayed, "You
know what's best, and I suppose he's got to go; but,
oh, Father, it's like tearing my heart out to send him!"</p>

<p>The time came. John and Mary went back to the
field. David went off to school, bravely choking down
the sobs, but with a pathetic, lost look in his eyes that
stabbed his parents' hearts. They tried to forget it,
and to rejoice in the thought of soon meeting again
the dear group of Christians in their old station. But,
no! A sudden call came, an urgent call to a hard
place, in an entirely different part of the field. After
much discussion and prayer, it was settled. There was
no chance to go to their old station, even for a visit.
Soon they were far away, among strangers, living in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
two rented rooms, and trying to straighten out a very
difficult church situation, the like of which they had
never before experienced.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Stories end, but life goes on and on. And the human
mind always seems to magnify the present difficulties,
and glamorize the possible future. John and
Mary thought that they had it rather hard their first
term, and that the second would be easier; but when
the second term actually began, and they looked back
on the first, they thought it had been nothing but
child's play!</p>

<p>Looking at that first term objectively, we can see
that John and Mary really did have a relatively easy
time. For one thing, they lived in only two places all
that time. For one reason or another missionaries
often have to move time and again. Someone who is
doing an absolutely indispensable job breaks down
and must go home on furlough, and you are the only
one who can take over. Or the work is being expanded,
and the older workers are scattered farther
afield as new ones come in. Perhaps there is a war,
and your station is in the fighting area, and you have
to evacuate. Whatever the reason is, suddenly you
find yourself in the midst of breaking up your home,
packing and moving, and then settling in a new place,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
finding new people and problems with which to get
acquainted, and perhaps a new dialect to learn.</p>

<p>Other things had been comparatively easy for John
and Mary too, that first term. They did not have any
fellow workers who were "difficult." It was not their
lot to start work in virgin territory, or where the people
were unfriendly. They did not get into any difficult
church situations. The church people were eager
to co-operate with them, and quick to profit by their
teaching and example. Even in the matter of health,
they did not have a more than average amount of
illness. And the story of their accomplishments during
that first term could truly be used as a model for
the young missionary's emulation!</p>

<p>This is not to say that John and Mary had no difficulties.
Difficulties are the normal thing on the mission
field, and they had their share. But they met
their difficulties, and they made good. How? Chiefly
by giving up some of their "rights," and foremost
among the rights they gave up was their chance for a
normal home life. There was rarely an evening when
John was at home and without a visitor; and if such
an evening came, he spent it at his books. Later he
was away from home for days and weeks, so that the
home had to function without the father much of the
time. John had to give up his right to spend a normal
amount of time with his wife and children. Even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Mary could not spend as much time with the children
as she would have liked, nor arrange things for them
as she might have wished. And then, after the first
few years, their home was not theirs alone. Most of
the time they had other people living with them. All
the way through they had to put the Lord's work first,
and their home second.</p>

<p>Yet was not this attitude of self-sacrifice the thing
that made their home a real Christian home? If they
had put their home first, not the work&mdash;if that home
had become a self-centered thing, a thing enjoyed for
its own sake&mdash;would it not have failed to be what
they wanted it to be? A home that is absorbed in itself
is not a truly Christian home. John was willing
to be away so much, and to sacrifice so much, because
his love for his Master was the all-consuming passion
of his life. It was for exactly that reason that his
presence&mdash;and even the consciousness of his absence,
and the reason for it&mdash;did bless that home. John and
Mary gladly took others into their home, really wanting
them, not because they did not appreciate having
their own home to themselves, but because their concern
for the work was greater than their natural desires.
They counted the cost, and sent their child away
from them, away to school, because they knew that
it was best for the child and best for the work. Love
for Christ was greater than love for home, or for children,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
and greater even than love for each other. If
they had held on to their right to home, and given it
first place, that would have meant losing it&mdash;losing
the Christ-centered home that they wanted. But in
giving it up they found it&mdash;found a home that truly
showed forth the love of Christ, because that love was
the compelling force of their individual lives.</p>

<h2><i>The Right to Live With the People of My Choice</i></h2>


<p>The six months of language school were almost
over. Exams had been the order of the day. In
spite of the fact that the results of their labors were
not yet known, half a dozen young women gathered
in the dormitory to celebrate with a cocoa party. Some
were sprawled on the beds, one was seated on the
floor, and another two were presiding over the concoction
simmering on a tiny, smoky kerosene stove.</p>

<p>"You know, I couldn't sleep a wink last night!"
declared one. "I was thinking about Mr. Gibb<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> coming
to appoint us to stations, and wondering what my
senior worker will be like, and I got so worried I
stayed awake all night!"</p>

<p>"You know the Lord is working it all out! We've
been praying about it for so long! You shouldn't
worry about it!" reproved another gently.</p>

<p>"Well, I tried, but the more I tried, the wider
awake I got."</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> foolish!" put in another. "Mr. Gibb
isn't even coming until tomorrow, and then who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
knows how soon <i>you</i> will have your interview with
him. It will take him several days they say, and your
name begins with <i>T</i>."</p>

<p>"It's all right for you to talk!" retorted the first
girl. "You have a sister out here, and you're taking
it for granted that you'll be sent to her. Of course
you're all right! But what about the rest of us who
have to be separated, and sent off to live with entire
strangers? How do I know whether my senior worker
will <i>like</i> me or not?"</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> don't need to worry," put in the quiet voice
of a girl who had not spoken before. "You are gay
and lively, and everybody likes you. I'm quiet and
awkward, and never know what to say. I'm sure my
senior worker will be disappointed when she gets
me!"</p>

<p>"Just listen to me a minute!" another voice spoke
up. "I'll tell you the one way out of this difficulty.
Everybody wants a congenial fellow worker. Well,
there's only one way to be sure, and that is&mdash;pick
your own! That's what I'm going to do!"</p>

<p>"Don't be stupid!" clamored three or four voices
at once. "Pick your own! Just as if we'd be allowed
to pick our own senior workers! What are you talking
about?"</p>

<p>"Just what I said. I'm picking my own senior
worker! Of course I may not be able to do it right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
away&mdash;I may have to live with one that Mr. Gibb
picks for me for a year or two&mdash;but I'm getting the
one I've picked for myself in the end!"</p>

<p>At that juncture two girls jumped upon the speaker,
and rolled her from the bed to the floor. "Just because
you are engaged you don't need to think you
are better than we are!" and the serious discussion
broke up with a laugh.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>With whom am I going to live and work for the
next six months? For the next six years? For the
rest of my life? Who will be the one I will see the
first thing in the morning, and the last thing at night,
and all the time in between? With whom will I sit
down at the table three times a day? Who will be
my fellow worker, my companion in recreation, the
one who spends time with me at the Throne of Grace,
pleading for souls, and for the upbuilding of God's
Church? Yes, it's quite a question. For somehow,
mission boards usually seem to recognize only one
legitimate reason for allowing a missionary to choose
his or her own fellow worker, and that one reason is
marriage. Even married couples will probably be
asked to take one or more younger workers into their
homes; and if you are one who remains single, why,
you will just have to let the superintendent, or committee,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
pick your companion and fellow worker for
you.</p>

<p>When I was in high school it was one of my ambitions
to learn to be at home in any environment.
Whether a wealthy home or a poverty-stricken one,
whether an American culture or the culture of some
other group, I wanted to be able to live in that environment
as though I had grown up in it. This ambition
was no doubt laudable and its attainment is very
useful to the missionary. I found later, however, that
it does not quite go to the heart of the problem. My
ambition at present is not so much to be able to live
happily in any <i>environment</i> as to be able to live happily
with any other <i>missionary</i>.</p>

<p>This statement may horrify some of my readers.
If I had said I make it my ambition to be able to live
happily with anyone, you would have had no bone to
pick with me. But no, I <i>must</i> say, <i>with any other missionary</i>!
Am I trying to imply that some missionaries
are hard to live with? That class of God's devoted
servants who have given up all to go for Him to the
far corners of the earth? Let anyone else be hard to
get along with, but surely not missionaries!</p>

<p>Well, missionaries (excepting some feeble folk
like me) are the salt of the earth. At the same time,
my experience on the foreign field leads me to the
conclusion that it takes a good deal more grace to live<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
happily with one's fellow workers on the foreign field
than it does at home. Why? The reasons are varied.
I think I can safely say that most missionaries are
rather strong-minded. If they were not, perhaps they
would never have gotten to the foreign field! They
know what they want to do, and they know how they
want to do it. Most missionaries will agree on the
task to be accomplished; but what are the best means
to accomplish it&mdash;that is not always so easy to agree
upon! The older worker may think the younger worker's
plans wild and impracticable. The younger worker
may think the older worker stodgy and in a rut.
Perhaps both may be right. Happy the fellow workers
who can learn to discuss their pet ideas without heat!
Happy the fellow workers who can develop just the
right combination of initiative and co-operation!</p>

<p>It is hard to realize how closely one is shut up to
a fellow worker on the mission field. Probably there
are no others of your own race in the place where
you live. At home one can live with one group, work
with another, and have special friends that are entirely
apart from either group. On the field there is no one
else&mdash;no one who speaks your native tongue, understands
your background, or has the same pattern of
thought as yourself. Perhaps you are stationed with
one other worker. Every human heart longs for some
special friend; but this fellow worker may not be one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
you would have chosen for a special friend. Perhaps
she has some mannerisms that are irritating to you.
Perhaps you like dogs and she hates them. Perhaps
she believes in being extremely economical and you
like to spend money more freely. In some ways, as
two single missionaries live and work together, the relation
is as close as that between husband and wife;
but in this case the two <i>have not chosen one another</i>.
Of course the relationship is not established for life;
and the missionary who finds herself paired off with
an uncongenial fellow worker may console herself
by hoping that a change will come soon. That frame
of mind, however, is not exactly conducive to the sort
of adjustment that would make for the most effective
carrying on of the work.</p>

<p>Even married couples will feel this to a certain extent.
A young married couple will probably have to
live with an older couple for the first two or three
years on the field. Owing perhaps to the shortage of
men, and perhaps to other reasons, it even happens
that sometimes a young married couple is sent to live
for their "breaking-in" period with one or two older
single lady missionaries! The initial period passes,
and they are given a home and a work of their own.
But they are not likely to be left alone long. Younger
workers will be coming along, and most married
couples are rarely without other workers living in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
their homes. Besides this, it is likely that the husband
will need to be away from home for weeks and even
months at a time, leaving the wife at home with the
little ones and the junior workers.</p>

<p>The single worker feels the force of this even more
strongly. Two good friends <i>may</i> be placed in a station
together; or what is more likely, two who have
been placed together may become especially good
friends. The fact that they are good friends, however,
cannot be a reason for placing them together, nor
for leaving them together. Any of us would realize
that. The placing of workers is determined by the
best interests of the work. If, when the best interests
of the work are considered, it seems right to place
two special friends together, or to leave them together,
well and good. If not, why, that's the end of
it!</p>

<p>Not being able to choose my own fellow worker
will present two possible difficulties for me. One is
that I may be placed with someone who does not appeal
to me. The other is that I may be separated
from someone with whom I strongly desire to remain.
The first difficulty is one that comes along now and
then. Probably most missionaries, at one time or
another, have had a period of living with someone
with whom they did not seem to "hit it off." The
second difficulty is, for the unmarried worker at least,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
of much more common occurrence. Over and over
again it happens. Just when you and someone else
have lived together long enough to rub off the rough
corners, and come to a place where you really "fit,"
along comes an upheaval, and you are separated. We
like to put down roots. We like to make friends and
stay with them, but on the mission field frequent
change of location and of fellow workers is the normal
thing. New personnel is constantly being added,
and older workers are constantly retiring. New stations
are constantly being opened. And the single
worker, time and time again, finds herself being separated
from a fellow worker with whom she would
prefer to remain permanently!</p>

<p>Some will notice that I have been using pronouns
in the feminine gender. This is not without reason,
since by far the majority of single workers on the
field are women. And, as has been said, one of the
hardest things the single woman worker must face is
that she can never say to anyone, "I'm going to stay
with you."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"What a negative sort of outlook!" exclaims someone;
and we must thank that one for reminding us
that there is a <i>positive</i> side. There is One whom we
<i>may</i> choose for our Companion. (How amazing that
I should be allowed to <i>choose Him</i>!) And it is just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
because we have already chosen the one Companion
who will not leave us that we may not choose anyone
else&mdash;not even a husband or wife&mdash;without reference
to Him. As soon as we choose Him, then He
does all our choosing for us.</p>

<p>According to old Oriental custom, marriages were
arranged by parents with the aid of a middleman.
Sometimes when things went wrong after marriage
one of the couple, or both, would blame the middleman.
When marriages are made after the Western
pattern, there is no one to blame but oneself. Before
I left America I used to think that marriages arranged
by parents, through middlemen, must necessarily be
unhappy. But after I had been on the field for a time
I decided that in China the proportion of happy marriages
among those outside of Christ was greater than
marriages of those of the same group in America,
even though almost all the marriages in China were
made after the old traditional style! People who
choose partners for themselves do not always choose
wisely. Older people, with more experience, may
make a wiser choice than the young people themselves
would have done. It <i>may</i> be better to have a trustworthy
middleman than to try to do the choosing oneself!</p>

<p>If this is true of an earthly middleman, how much
more it is true of the One who chooses for <i>us</i>! The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
earthly middleman may do very well in many cases,
but certainly he makes some mistakes. The One who
chooses for us makes no mistakes. So whether it be
a matter of accepting a fellow worker you would
rather not have, or of letting go one whom you would
like to keep&mdash;remember the One who does the choosing
for us makes no mistakes.</p>

<h2><i>The Right to Feel Superior</i></h2>


<p>The meeting of the Missionary Union had closed.
The Bible Institute students were leaving the
room in groups, and many of them were discussing
the message which they had just heard.</p>

<p>"What did you think of his last point?" asked one.</p>

<p>"That about race prejudice, you mean? About not
thinking that because our skin is white, we're better
than anyone else? To tell the truth, it seemed a bit
superfluous to me. I suppose race prejudice and race
pride still do exist, but not in a group like this. Why,
we're practically all missionary candidates!"</p>

<p>"Just what I thought myself!" rejoined the first.
"You'd think he'd gotten his audience mixed. But
he knew he was talking to missionary candidates, all
right. That's the strange part. The rest of his talk&mdash;it
was the real stuff. But that one point&mdash;I just
couldn't make it out."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's just fifty years out of date, that's all,"
commented another. "That's the way it was when <i>he</i>
went to the field&mdash;the imperialistic white man and
the downtrodden native&mdash;but times have changed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
People wouldn't act like that now. Each race has its
own culture, and its own contribution to make to enrich
the culture of the world. We realize all this
now. The Christian world has come a long way since
<i>he</i> was in training. Pride of race! We're more likely
to be ashamed of our race, if he only knew it. Look
at the state the world's in&mdash;all trouble stirred up by
the white race!"</p>

<p>"Some of those old missionaries <i>were</i> imperialistic,
all right!" A slight, blond youth joined the conversation.
"You should hear some of the tales my father
tells! Ordering the native people around as if they
were slaves! Such cases were few and far between, of
course. But, you know, I don't think that's the sort
of thing he was driving at. Times may change, but
not the human heart. Pride is just as easy a sin to
fall into as it ever was. Thinking that we're better
than someone else&mdash;it may not be because of our
race, but merely because the other fellow is poor or
uneducated&mdash;we can't just dismiss it and say, 'I'm in
no danger of that.'"</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps there's something&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw, just because you grew up on a mission field&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know, <i>I</i> think&mdash;" Several began to talk at
once. Suddenly a gong rang, and the group scattered
in all directions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Ann, I've been wanting to find you! A bunch
of us are planning to go to Tong's for a Chinese meal.
Do you want to come along?"</p>

<p>"Chinese meal? Dear me, I've never had one. Do
you have to eat with chopsticks? Don't they serve you
rats and mice and all sorts of horrible things?"</p>

<p>"Of course not, you silly! There are the most delicious
things! And you don't have to eat with chopsticks
unless you want to. In fact, they always give us
knives and forks unless we especially ask for chopsticks.
But I adore strange ways! This will be my
third time for Chinese food. We always ask for chopsticks&mdash;it's
the most fun trying to use them! Though
I must admit that we usually give up halfway&mdash;the
food is so delicious and we're so hungry we have to.
Then you'll come?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;to tell the truth, I'm afraid it will be
some awful stuff I can't eat."</p>

<p>"I'm surprised at you, Ann! You're a missionary
candidate, aren't you? You'll <i>have</i> to get used to
strange&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, but it seems so sort of uncivilized to eat with
sticks, or fingers&mdash;and all out of one dish, isn't it?
Ugh!"</p>

<p>"Now don't be fussy! Didn't you hear that missionary
talk last night? You've got to appreciate other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
people's ways on the mission field&mdash;can't go around
thinking your ways are best!"</p>

<p>"I know." Ann was suddenly very serious. "But
there's only one thing about it that bothers me. What
if your own ways really <i>are</i> best?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Chopsticks, or knives and forks&mdash;which are best?
Not which are the most intriguing, or cause the most
hilarity, but which really and truly are the most useful
for their purpose&mdash;that of conveying food to one's
mouth in a convenient and graceful manner. Don't
condemn Ann offhand. If I were to ask <i>you</i> this question,
what answer would <i>you</i> give?</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;really&mdash;" you say. "After all&mdash;" Yes.
That's just it. You, and Ann, and millions more can't
help realizing (or is it feeling?) that your way <i>is</i>
best. But what about the millions in China and
Japan? How would they answer the question? Did
you ever stop to think that their reaction would be
just as immediate, and their answer just as sure? And
I think I am safe in saying that a larger proportion
of them have actually tried using the other person's
implements than we have.</p>

<p>When a group of ex-China missionaries get together
at home and go to a Chinese restaurant for a
meal, the first thing they do after ordering is to request
that the food be served in bowls, and they be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
supplied with chopsticks instead of knives and forks.
Why? Ask any of them. The reply you will probably
get is, "Oh, it doesn't taste the same when eaten with
knives and forks!" And the strange part about it is
that it is really true.</p>

<p>"But," you say, "chopsticks are so difficult to use!"
Not at all! You just need a little practice. Even
knives and forks are difficult for beginners to manage.
You would know that if you had watched as many
beginners (adults) try to use them as I have.</p>

<p>"No, but you can't cut anything with them!" Of
course you can't. The kitchen is the place for cutting
up food. To serve a slab of meat on a plate, and expect
the eater to saw off pieces with a dull knife&mdash;it's
utterly barbarous! Chinese food is properly prepared,
bite-size, in the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Oh? But what about soup or gravy? You can't
eat <i>them</i> with chopsticks!" Quite true; neither can
you eat them with knife and fork. Chinese eat soup
with a spoon, or drink it from a bowl.</p>

<p>"Well, chopsticks are awkward, in any case!" Awkward?
What are you talking about? They are just
like pincers&mdash;you nip a bite and pick it up daintily,
instead of spearing, or shoveling, as you do with a
fork.</p>

<p>It's amazing how hard it is for an American (I
won't speak for other nationalities!) to come to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
place where he will appreciate the fact that the ways
of people in other lands are in many cases better for
them than our ways would be. If you are going to the
foreign field in order to teach "the American way of
life," you had better stay at home. In saying this I do
not mean that Americans do not have some skills that
it might be advantageous for the people on some foreign
mission fields to learn. But any missionary who
has the feeling that his ways of doing things are better
just because they are "civilized" ways, or "American"
ways, or just his own ways, is heading for trouble.</p>

<p>When I first went to China I thought I had no
feeling of race superiority. Then an incident occurred
that showed me I was not as humble as I had thought.
It was at the Chinese New Year season. Chinese New
Year is the time of preparing all sorts of special foods,
and frequently at that time some of the Christian
women would send us a bowl of this, or a plate of
that. There was a neighborly feeling about it all that
warmed my heart. Then one year a fairly wealthy
Christian woman, who had just recently moved to
our city, sent her servant over with a gift of a different
kind. It was not food this time, but money. In
purchasing value the amount would have been equivalent
to an American dollar or two. It was the first
money gift that had ever been presented to me by a
Chinese.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>I had always been pleased with the gifts of food,
but somehow, when I saw what this gift was, I reacted
strongly against it. There was something in me that
rebelled. "<i>I</i> don't need your money!" was my instinctive
reaction. Fortunately I had enough politeness
left to realize that I could not refuse it without offending
the giver, and so I did take it, mumbling my
thanks, which I did not feel, and watched the servant
depart. Then I sat down to think it out. <i>Why</i> did it
make me so uncomfortable to accept that gift? When
I finally got to the bottom of it, I decided that the
real reason was that I unconsciously felt that it put
me in an inferior position. Accepting a gift of food
was different&mdash;that was just neighborliness. But a
small gift of money! That is normally given by a superior
to an inferior&mdash;a father to his child, a mistress
to her servant, one who has sufficient for his needs to
one who has not. In this case the giver did not look
at it like that, of course. Money gifts were a common
thing in her circle, and to her the amount was not too
small. But my unconscious reaction was that I was
being put in an inferior position, and this was the
thing at which I rebelled. How could I, who was this
woman's superior (this was my unconscious feeling),
take this money, and so accept the place of being her
inferior?</p>

<p>The position of a missionary is something like that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
of a teacher. He comes to tell people something that
they do not know; to introduce a Friend of whom
they have not heard. He certainly knows more about
Christianity, academically and experimentally, than
the people to whom he goes&mdash;otherwise there would
be no point in his going. He probably knows more
about the world in general than the people to whom
he goes. He may know better ways of living and
working, even for their environment, than they do.
How can a person be conscious of how much more he
knows than someone else, and still not feel <i>superior</i>?
Those among whom he works may realize that he
knows much that they should learn, and may look up
to him as a superior being. This makes it even harder.
How can he overcome the superiority complex that
comes from race, or from looking on oneself as <i>civilized</i>,
or even just from recognizing that one has more
education and experience than those among whom he
works?</p>

<p>The first step in conquering this superiority complex
is to realize that it is there. Most of us have it
without realizing it. If we realize that this thing probably
exists somewhere in our make-up, it will be
easier to recognize it when it suddenly rears its head,
as it did with me. Seeing it for what it is is the first
step in conquering it. The second step, I think, is to
become thoroughly acquainted with those to whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
we go. Perhaps if we know more about them we will
not find them so inferior. Go and live their life with
them, twenty-four hours of the day. Don't just put
yourself in the position of an observer, but try to do
the things that they do. You will probably find that
you are not as proficient in doing most of the things
that they do as are their ten-year-old children! If your
people are <i>uncivilized</i>, go into the jungle with them
and try to wrest your living from the jungle&mdash;try to
find or make everything that you need. If they are
<i>civilized</i>, but poor and backward, go into their homes,
and live their lives with them. See how they grow
their own food, and that without the use of modern
machinery; how they grind their own grain into flour,
salt or dry their own vegetables, butcher their own
meat&mdash;if they have any; how they raise cotton, pick
it, card it, spin it, dye it, weave it into cloth, and make
the clothes for the family without the aid of a sewing
machine. And then watch them (as I often have)
make beautiful embroidery for relaxation! By the
time you have become really familiar with (I won't
say proficient in) their way of life, I think you will
have lost most of your feeling of superiority. You will
no more think of them as "ignorant savages," or
"those from lower cultural groups." Instead, they
will just be John, and Mary, and Peter, and Paul&mdash;or
whatever their names happen to be&mdash;real people,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
like you and me; real people, who are amazingly skillful
in some ways, and amazingly stupid in others,
just like the rest of us.</p>

<p>There is one more thing we need to do in conquering
that superiority complex. We need to realize
what a difference having Christ makes. Those to
whom we minister may live in the midst of filth and
disease. Their minds may be dull, and their hearts
dark and full of fears. (Were our ancestors any different
when Christ found them?) But see them come
to the One who is the Light of the world, and watch
the transformation that takes place. Then realize
more deeply than ever all that you owe to Christ,
and the greatness of His power in making the one
who comes to Him literally "a new creation." What
these people need is not a training that will educate
them out of their environment. What they need is
not to learn to use knives and forks instead of chopsticks
or fingers. What they need is a <span class="smcap">Life</span> that will
transform them, and enable them to live a life of
victory over sin and the Devil within their environment.
This imparted life may gradually transform
that environment too&mdash;probably it will; but that is
a secondary thing. There is one thing that is essential,
and one alone&mdash;the impartation of the life of Christ.
It does not matter how low, how ignorant, how degraded
the person is, Christ is <i>able</i> to transform him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
into someone far superior to me; and it may be that
that is <i>just what He is going to do</i>. Who am I, a poor
redeemed sinner, to look down upon anyone else?
Who am I to challenge Christ's power, and refuse to
believe that anyone can be made new?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Dear Lord, forgive me for feeling that I am superior
to anyone! Open my eyes to see how deep was
the pit from which I was digged! Grant that I may
make myself one with the people to whom Thou art
sending me, and that by faith I can see them transformed
by Thy power, even before that transformation
has taken place!</i></p></div>

<h2><i>The Right to Run Things</i></h2>


<p>A new mission station opened! Another conquest
of the Gospel! Have you ever wondered
how it was done? Suppose you are a missionary, and
have already passed successfully through the language-learning
stage. Suppose you are assigned an
area where the Gospel has never been preached, an
area teeming with people, very few of whom have
ever even heard the precious name of Jesus. You
probably have a fellow worker. You have good
health, a reasonable knowledge of the language and
local customs, and a heart on fire for God. You have
a certain amount of financial resources. What do you
do? How do you start in?</p>

<p>Let's see what Mr. Beaver did. When assigned to
this new, untouched field, his heart and the heart of
his wife were deeply moved. Ten thousand souls and
more, and probably not one of them a Christian! Ten
thousand souls and more, and it might well be that
none of them had ever heard the Gospel preached in
any adequate way! Ten thousand souls and more,
and the large majority of them had never even heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the name of Jesus! What an opportunity! What a
challenge!</p>

<p>"Such a challenge calls for action," ruminated Mr.
Beaver. "It calls for immediate action, and yet action
that is well planned, and will be as effective as possible.
How can we reach the largest number of souls
for Christ in the shortest time? But what can two people
do, anyway? We must have helpers. We must
have a church building, and a native evangelist or
two. We must have a street chapel. We must have a
Christian school, for through it we can reach countless
numbers of young people. Our church and school
will be established in the central city of the area, of
course. But then, think of all the smaller towns and
villages! As soon as things get going in the city, we
must start outstations in strategic market towns as
well. We must organize tent campaigns, making use
of modern equipment&mdash;public address system, recordings,
films, and all the rest. We must also start a
social welfare program that will help us to get in
touch with the poorer classes&mdash;and aren't the bulk
of the people always poor? A certain amount of relief
funds, administered carefully to the deserving,
will make the love of Christ known in a practical way,
and surely will attract folk to our church."</p>

<p>So ran the thoughts of Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, and,
because they were "go-getters," their plans were soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
put into effect. A fine piece of property was purchased.
Buildings were erected: a residence for themselves,
a preaching hall opening directly on the main
street, fine school buildings, and a beautiful church
building. Crowds of people came to listen to the singing,
to see Christian films, and to hear the Gospel
preached in simplicity and power. It was not long before
people were giving their names as inquirers. The
missionaries' servants were among the first to respond,
and their friends and relatives followed. Other helpers
around the place were needed: a gardener, a gatekeeper,
and so on, and naturally these were chosen
from among the first converts. Soon the busy compound
was like one happy family&mdash;all gathering the
first thing in the morning for prayer, and joining
their voices in song, praising the One of whom they
had never heard three months ago, but who now was
their acknowledged Saviour. Callers came from morning
till night. Mr. Beaver was never too busy to see
them, to hear their tales of woe, to point them to the
Saviour, and to give them a little judicious help.</p>

<p>"It's not too wise," he thought, "to give out a lot
of money for nothing. I don't want to make paupers
of these people. What they need is jobs, and someone
who will encourage them to work, training them if
necessary. Let's see&mdash;I've got quite a bit of relief
funds in hand; and there's plenty of work that needs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
to be done to improve this property. So-and-so [one
of the new inquirers] is a builder; I'll put him in
charge of operations, and we'll take on all these poor
people who need help&mdash;much better than giving
them help outright&mdash;and we'll really put this place
into shape. Not only will our property benefit, but it
will also give these people a chance to hear the Gospel
again and again, until they really understand it.
I'm sure that many of them will accept the Lord if
this plan goes through!"</p>

<p>And so things went. Such large numbers gave their
names as inquirers, and they studied and attended
services so faithfully that within six months the first
baptismal service was held. What joy it brought to the
hearts of Mr. and Mrs. Beaver! Two other such services
were held before the first year was up, and by
that time Mr. Beaver felt it right to appoint deacons,
and to get the church on an organized basis. He chose
several of the most promising young people, including
one who had served in his home, and sent them
off to a Bible institute, looking forward with great
joy to the time when they would graduate and come
back to help him in the work. Then he would be able
to let his original evangelists go (they were getting
a bit too bossy anyway, and thought they knew how
the Lord's work should be carried on better than he
did!), and have only his own spiritual children associated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
with him in the work. They would all work
happily under his direction, and surely the Lord could
bless more where the workers were all one in heart.
Well, he wouldn't say that these evangelists were <i>not</i>
one in heart with him, but still&mdash;sometimes he felt
that there was just a little something lacking. Sometimes
they didn't support his plans with all the enthusiasm
that they might.</p>

<p>By the time three more years had passed, Mr.
Beaver had put up church buildings in six market
towns, and was just waiting until his first young people
graduated from the Bible institute and came back
before starting regular weekly services in the last
three of the six towns. He traveled constantly, and
wherever he went the people flocked to him for help
and advice. True, there were one or two that turned
against him, but one couldn't expect the Lord's work
always to be easy; and the large majority looked to
him as children to a father. There were elders as well
as deacons in the church now, and when he presided
at their meetings and looked over the group, his own
spiritual children now taking their places as leaders
in the church, his heart just melted. True, they were
a bit hesitant about going ahead, and always consulted
him before making plans, but that was only natural
and right. After all, they had only a few years' experience
in the church and couldn't be expected to know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
how best to govern the House of God. Indeed, several
times he had found it necessary to put his foot
down when one of them, a little less experienced and
more reckless than the others, had advanced his own
ideas of how church affairs should be managed. But
he had soon subsided and realized his mistake. What
a happy family the church was, indeed, with everything
working out just as he had planned it! Truly
God was good!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>At the time when Mr. Beaver went to his new station
and began putting his magnificent plans into
effect, another worker was sent, in the same way, to a
new area. Mr. Trainer was perhaps not so dynamic an
individual, but he knew just as clearly what his plans
were for the church that was as yet unborn. "The
church, which is his body"&mdash;the Body of Christ! The
Church which is, through the indwelling Christ, the
light of the world! The Church, where each member
is in vital contact with the Head, and so, necessarily,
is in vital contact with every other member! The
Church, each member of which is indwelt by the Holy
Spirit, and each member of which feels his responsibility
to live and witness for the One who means all
in all to him! The church Mr. Trainer wanted to
plant was a church which was all this&mdash;a church
which was a living plant, with its roots going down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
into God; a church which did not look to the missionary,
or any other man, for its needs, but which was
centered upon Christ; a church which would be given
"gifts" by the Holy Spirit, and would be able to use
those gifts to the edifying of itself, and the bringing
of souls into the kingdom.</p>

<p>Mr. Trainer, like Mr. Beaver, went to the central
city of his area and located on a main street. His
"compound" was a tiny rented house, with a pocket-handkerchief-size
courtyard. He did no building at
all, and his few rooms were sparsely furnished. Books
were the only things he seemed to own. There were
books everywhere, said his callers, but not much else&mdash;some
perfectly ordinary furniture, and that was all.
He had no street chapel, and no paid workers brought
in from the outside; but day by day he set a table and
a few stools in his gateway, covered the table with attractive
Gospel literature printed in the language of
the people, and there he sat and read. Passersby
stopped to examine his books. One and all received
an attractive Gospel tract, and had the message explained
in simple language as long as they cared to
listen. Some bought Gospels and other booklets. A
few got into the habit of dropping by every evening,
when work was done; and Mr. Trainer taught them
to sing Gospel songs and choruses, and read the Word
with them. At other times he went from shop to shop,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
giving out tracts, and inviting people to call when
they had time.</p>

<p>The compound of Mr. Trainer was tiny, compared
with that of Mr. Beaver. He had no school, and no
church building. He did not even hold church services
at first&mdash;who was there to come? Not another
Christian in all that area. He did not attract huge
crowds. He did not spend large sums of money, nor
employ large numbers of people. People did not come
to him for financial assistance&mdash;what would be the
use, when he did not seem to have any more money
than anyone else? But he attracted a few, a few
"whose heart the Lord opened," and day by day he
taught them more about the Saviour. It was a full
year before he had a baptismal service. The numbers
baptized were far smaller than those baptized by Mr.
Beaver, but the joy in his heart was just as real.</p>

<p>Even before these converts were baptized, Mr.
Trainer started teaching them about the Church. He
taught them that they were indwelt by the Holy
Spirit. He led them daily to the Throne of Grace,
and from the beginning they learned to pray. He encouraged
in them the desire to win others of their
own households and their friends. He encouraged
them to witness, both in their own group, and to those
who did not know Christ. He encouraged them to
bring others to the little evening gathering, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
to testify in front of these whom they had brought.
He did not make too many concrete suggestions, but
prayed, and waited for the Holy Spirit to suggest
ways and means of witnessing to them. Soon he was
invited to their homes to talk to others in their families
about the Lord. He always made such occasions
an opportunity for the one who invited him there to
speak, asking for that one's personal testimony, as
well as speaking himself. Sometimes others of the
group went along, and they too had a chance to testify.
Then it came about quite naturally that the little
informal evening meeting was held in the different
homes, rather than always in that of Mr. Trainer.
Soon different ones were taking turns leading, with
spontaneous testimonies, or sharing of "wonderful
thoughts" from the Word that came to them in their
own private devotions. They would tell about opportunities
they had to witness for the Lord, and there
would be prayer all around for the requests brought
before the group. Soon other souls were coming to
the Saviour, not because of the direct efforts of the
missionary, but rather through the instrumentality of
these young Christians. That, felt Mr. Trainer, was
the greatest triumph of all!</p>

<p>Although he was eager to start street meetings, Mr.
Trainer did not want this to be his own personal
effort, but rather a church effort. So he restrained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
himself and said nothing, but prayed constantly about
the matter. What was his joy when one day one of
them asked, "Couldn't we have a meeting somewhere
where more people would come, and we could preach
the Gospel to them?" When no one seemed to be
able to think of a building both suitable and available,
he permitted himself to make a suggestion about
open-air meetings he had attended. Never having
heard of such a thing, some were doubtful, others
amazed. He answered questions about how such meetings
were run, but made no recommendation. He
heard no more about the subject for a week or two,
and then suddenly the whole group (who had been
consulting together, it seemed) came to him, eager
to have an open-air meeting, with his assistance. Careful
preparations were made, musical instruments
some of them had were requisitioned, and the first
street meeting was held. Although no actual decisions
for Christ were made, a good crowd listened, and the
Christians were so pleased that from that day the
open-air meeting became a regular thing.</p>

<p>Trying to witness or bring a short Gospel message
in these meetings brought home to the young Christians
their need for more Bible study, so a regular
Bible study class was instituted two nights a week,
instead of the usual meeting for testimony and prayer.
At first they concentrated on helping the speakers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
prepare their messages for the next street meeting.
Later they chose a Book of the Bible, or a certain topic,
and asked Mr. Trainer to lead them in their study.
Notebooks were filled, and practical methods of Bible
study became familiar processes, but most of all they
learned to look to the Holy Spirit to take the Word
given by His own inspiration and interpret it to their
hearts.</p>

<p>When the very first ones came to the Lord, Mr.
Trainer had suggested that they meet on the Lord's
Day. He had usually taken charge of that service
himself. By the time there were a dozen or so baptized
Christians, he encouraged them to feel that
they, like the Jerusalem church in Acts 6, should
choose deacons. The group spent much time in prayer,
looking to the Lord for His guidance, and when the
deacons were actually chosen, all felt that they were
not just their own choice, but men chosen by the Holy
Spirit. After they were chosen, he turned over all the
services to them, and suggested that they take turns
in leading the Sunday morning service, and also
speaking at that service. He would be glad to take
his turn with the others. And so it was carried out.</p>

<p>All this time they had been meeting in the various
homes. The inconvenience of unsuitable rooms and
never having enough benches had been felt for some
time, so when the deacons took over they decided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
that something must be done about it. Didn't other
places have church buildings? Why couldn't they?
Some of the group had the idea that there was some
kind of a mission or church somewhere that provided
money for such things, so off they went to inquire of
the missionary. He explained to them clearly that
there <i>were</i> mission boards that provided funds, in
whole or part, for church buildings in many places;
but that this did not seem to be the New Testament
way, nor was it the way to build a strong local church.
"It would be far better," he said, "to meet in a shanty
put up by yourselves, than in a beautiful building that
cost you nothing." They had several long talks on the
subject, and soon all the Christians were deeply concerned.
It seemed impossible to out-argue Mr.
Trainer. At the same time it seemed even more impossible
to do what he thought they ought to do&mdash;contribute
enough money to build their own church
building! Only twelve or fifteen baptized Christians,
and several of them women or young people from
homes where the head of the house did not believe&mdash;what
could they do? Mr. Trainer would only counsel
them to pray. And pray they did&mdash;there seemed to
be nothing else they could do. Finally the deacons
made a special offering box for gifts for the new
church building, and the money began to come in.
The gifts were more than they expected; and yet they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
were but a drop in the bucket compared with what
was needed. Time passed, and the fund slowly grew.
Suggestions of "church bazaars" and "fun fairs" were
made several times (wherever had they heard of such
things?). Mr. Trainer counseled against them, but
did not feel that he had the authority to forbid. After
all, the church was standing on its own feet, and it
stood or fell to Christ alone! But he spent much time
in prayer, and none of these suggestions was put into
effect.</p>

<p>One Sunday an electrifying announcement was
made. A wealthy businessman in the city was offering
them a suitable piece of property for their building
as an outright gift! The Christians redoubled
their efforts in giving, and that month they received
ten times as much as they had received in any one
month before. A church in a city not too far away
heard of their efforts, and sent a contribution. Church
membership was growing, and all the new believers
became interested in giving. Then two of the deacons
made a proposal: "Why can't we do most of the work
on the building ourselves? That will make it much
less expensive!"</p>

<p>The plans needed careful working out, but assistance
was given by someone's neighbor, who was a
builder, and finally the work started. Many of them
put in long hours of back-breaking labor after their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
regular work for the day had been completed. Difficulties
appeared, but prayer and perseverance prevailed.
After the building was started, many more
gifts came in; and great was the rejoicing when the
simple little chapel was at last finished, and used for
its first Sunday morning service! Throngs of interested
neighbors and friends turned up for the meeting,
and several of the deacons took turns at preaching.
A guest speaker had also been invited, the pastor of
the church that had sent an unsolicited offering to
help with the building. The meeting went on for
more than two hours, but everyone was happy, and
again and again praises ascended to God for their
own church building!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A couple of years passed. The work of Mr. Beaver
and Mr. Trainer continued as begun. Then suddenly
the country was threatened by war. Worse still, the
missionaries were labeled as "enemy nationals." A
general evacuation took place. Both Mr. Beaver and
Mr. Trainer were due for furloughs; and even if they
had not been, remaining on the field could only bring
harm to the Christians. Both of them gathered up a
few things and departed, escaping from the country
just in time. If they had remained a few days longer,
they would have found themselves in concentration
camps. When they arrived at home, each had a thrilling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
tale to tell of how God had worked in saving
souls and building up His Church, and also of personal
deliverance in time of danger. At the end of
every message they gave came these words: "Pray for
the Christians there. Because of the war, there is no
way of getting news from them, and we have heard
nothing since we left. Pray that they may be kept
true, and that in spite of war and distress, the churches
may grow and expand, and that many more souls may
be brought to Christ."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The war was over. Friendly relations between countries
were again established. Both missionaries had
had profitable furloughs: time for rest and spiritual
refreshment, and many opportunities to make known
the needs, the difficulties, and the triumphs of the mission
field. Then&mdash;something happened. Both men
fully expected to get back to their original fields of
work, to see again those dear Christians, their sons
and daughters in the Lord&mdash;but neither did. Another
call came to each, and neither could return to his
former field. Others went instead&mdash;others who knew
little about the history of the stations, or what work
had been done there. What did these men find in
these two fields? I think you can guess!</p>

<p>Mr. Beaver's station had always been supplied with
plenty of money from abroad. By becoming a Christian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
a man could obtain a certain amount of relief
money, perhaps a job, or free schooling for his children.
Many had learned "the language of Zion" and
had been taken into the church who had never had a
change of heart. When war broke out and the missionary
left, the jobs were finished, and the school
closed down. There was no one to pay the evangelists,
and they gradually drifted away to other places or into
secular jobs. The deacons and elders had been accustomed
to taking orders from Mr. Beaver and had had
no real experience in looking after things themselves.
Even some of those leaders were of the group that had
joined the church, not because they had really repented
and turned to Christ, but for the material
benefits they could get.</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Beaver left, they quarreled among
themselves as to which one would take his place and
be the "big chief." There was no one capable of taking
services, because such things had always been in
the hands of Mr. Beaver and his paid workers, who
now were gone. None of the elders or deacons had
ever preached a sermon in his life. Some tried, but
their efforts did not draw the crowds, and attendance
soon dwindled to almost nothing. Then quarrels
about the property began. True, it belonged not to
them, but to the mission board; but surely it was up
to the church to look after it while the missionary was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
gone! Several so-called Christian families moved into
the empty buildings, with or without the agreement
of the deacons and elders; but then, thought they, the
buildings <i>should</i> be occupied, and of course these people
will pay us rent! (They never did.) Church services
gradually ceased. A few faithful Christians remained
true to the Lord, and met in a home for occasional
services; but since none had been trained to
lead meetings, all they could do was sing, read the
Bible, and pray.</p>

<p>But what had happened at the other station? There
the case was far different. They had gone through
the sorrows of war, but they had done so with the
Lord at their side. Continuing the work of the church
was no problem&mdash;they had been doing it themselves
all along. Money was hard to get, and many young
men had to go to war; but the hearts of the people
were open as never before, and they had baptisms
once and again. They missed Mr. Trainer very much;
but they were driven more than ever to the Lord,
and found Him sufficient for their every need.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It is easy to say that one man was right and the
other was wrong. But how many of us would not
have followed in the footsteps of Mr. Beaver if we
had not been warned? And how many of us missionaries
today, even though warned, are not still in danger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
of making ourselves the little center around which
the mission station revolves?</p>

<p>"It's all very well to say that the Christians should
take the responsibility from the very beginning," we
think; "but <i>here</i> it is impossible. These people are
too poor! And they are too ignorant! No, they certainly
would do everything wrong if I let them take
the lead!" And so we go on telling everyone what he
ought to do, and seeing that he does it; and in the
eyes of the young believers the Christian life becomes
simply a matter of doing what the missionary says.</p>

<p>That is not the way that Paul built churches. Great
and dynamic character that he was, he so taught and
led his groups of young Christians that when after a
few months or a year or two he left them they were
able to carry on by themselves, and even to grow. He
did not put up church buildings for them, nor schools,
nor give them "grants." He brought them to the
place where they could function as living churches, in
direct union with the Head, and not centered upon
himself. His efforts were directed to building up
churches that would be able to stand alone, because
they stood in the strength of the One who upheld
Paul.</p>

<p>Why is it so easy for us missionaries to think that
we know how to do the work of the Lord better than
any mission field convert, especially if that one has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
been led to the Lord by us? Doing the Lord's work is
not fundamentally a matter of knowledge, training,
or even experience. It may be true that I have had
years of Bible training, and the little old woman with
whom I am going out visiting has never been to any
sort of school a day in her life; that I have traveled
around the world, and she has never been thirty miles
from the place where she was born; that I have heard
the Gospel and studied the Bible all my life, and she
has known it for only a few short years. I was born
again twenty-five or thirty years ago; she has been the
Lord's own for three or four years. Suppose we go to
call on someone who is ill or in trouble. I get out a
poster, and carefully explain the Gospel. The woman
we are visiting listens to me with her mouth open;
and after twenty minutes of as clear and simple
preaching as I am capable of, when I am just getting
to my climax, she lays her hand on my sleeve and asks
earnestly, "Did you make this dress yourself?"</p>

<p>My heart sinks to my boots. Is that what she has
been thinking about all this time? Is that why she
fixed her eyes on me so intently? What's the use
anyway?</p>

<p>Then the old lady who is with me starts in. <i>She</i>
can't even tell clearly the bare outlines of the life of
our Saviour; but she turns to the woman, one whose
life and thoughts she knows (wasn't she just like her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
before she was saved?), and says, "Look at me! I
used to have this trouble and that trouble and the
other trouble, and then I came to Jesus, and asked
Him to forgive my sins. He did it and took all my
troubles away, and gave me peace and joy in my
heart as I never dreamed of. Come to Him and you
can have it too!"</p>

<p>When the one on whom we are calling says suddenly,
"I'm going to believe too," it is far more likely
to be the result of my companion's testimony than of
my fine Gospel message!</p>

<p>Are you a missionary volunteer? When you get to
the mission field, remember that a simple, earnest
testimony from one who is "just like we are" will usually
bring far more in the way of results than your
own best efforts. Don't think that the missionary is
the only one who can bring souls to the Lord. The
one who has just been saved may easily become a
more effective witness than you yourself.</p>

<p>No matter how uneducated and degraded the
group, there are always in it one or more who are
leaders. No matter how poor and ignorant he is, the
one who has been truly saved, and knows that he is
saved, is always capable of witnessing to others of his
own group. No matter how poor a little group of
Christians is, if they continue in prayer and patient
effort they will surely be able to provide for themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
a meeting house that is as good as their own
homes, or a little better. The Church of God is not
dependent upon Gothic arches and stained glass windows,
upon ministers in Geneva gowns and upon
robed choirs. It is not dependent upon material resources,
or this world's learning. None of these things
are essentials. The only things that are essentials to
the Church of Christ are found in Christ and in the
penitent and forgiven soul, no matter what his race
or culture or economic status. The Church of Christ
can function on any level at which men for whom
Christ died are living.</p>

<p>It is very easy for the missionary to become a little
"pope." God forbid that we should do this! God forbid
that we should consider ourselves the exclusive
channels for bringing God's grace to needy souls, or
the only ones capable of hearing God's voice! God
forbid that we should forget that every believer, as
soon as he is born again, is indwelt by the Holy Spirit!
And may God open our eyes to ways and means of
doing what is perhaps the greatest task of the missionary,
the task of bringing the young church to the
place where it can get along without us, the task of
working ourselves out of a job!</p>
